This problem is a **dynamic programming** problem. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### Key Observations:
1. **Domino and Tromino Shapes**:
   - A 2x1 domino can cover two adjacent squares.
   - A tromino can cover three squares in an "L" shape.

2. **Ways to Tile**:
   - We can approach tiling a 2x\(n\) board by breaking it into smaller problems using the domino and tromino shapes.

3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to tile a 2x\(i\) board.
   - We can derive a recurrence relation:
     - Place a vertical domino: Reduces the problem to tiling a 2x(\(i-1\)) board.
     - Place two horizontal dominoes: Reduces the problem to tiling a 2x(\(i-2\)) board.
     - Use a tromino shape: This creates additional configurations that depend on adjacent boards.
   - To handle the effect of trominoes, introduce an auxiliary array `f[i]` to track "partial configurations."

---

### Recurrence Relations:
1. \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 \times f[i-1] \)
   - The first term corresponds to a vertical domino.
   - The second term corresponds to two horizontal dominoes.
   - The last term accounts for the configurations involving trominoes.

2. \( f[i] = f[i-1] + dp[i-2] \)
   - The auxiliary array tracks the ways to form partial tilings that can be completed in later steps.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - \( dp[0] = 1 \): One way to tile an empty board.
   - \( dp[1] = 1 \): One way to tile a 2x1 board using a single domino.
   - \( f[0] = 0 \): No partial tiling for an empty board.

---

### Implementation (Python):
```python
def numTilings(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Base cases
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2

    # Initialize dp and f arrays
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    f = [0] * (n + 1)

    dp[0], dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 1, 2

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        f[i - 1] = (f[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]) % MOD
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + 2 * f[i - 1]) % MOD

    return dp[n]
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The base cases for \( dp[0] \), \( dp[1] \), and \( dp[2] \) are initialized.
   - \( f[0] \) is initialized to 0 because no partial configuration exists for an empty board.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate from \( i = 3 \) to \( n \), updating \( f[i-1] \) and \( dp[i] \) based on the recurrence relations.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, take modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) at each step to avoid overflow.

---

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
- The 5 ways to tile a 2x3 board are:
  1. Three vertical dominoes.
  2. One horizontal domino at the top and two vertical dominoes.
  3. One horizontal domino at the bottom and two vertical dominoes.
  4. A tromino shape at the left, and one vertical domino on the right.
  5. A tromino shape at the right, and one vertical domino on the left.
```

#### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Only one way to tile a 2x1 board with a single vertical domino.
```

---

### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - \( O(n) \): We compute \( dp[i] \) and \( f[i] \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( n \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - \( O(n) \): We use two arrays, `dp` and `f`, each of size \( n+1 \).

---

### Output for Given Inputs:
```python
print(numTilings(3))  # Output: 5
print(numTilings(1))  # Output: 1
print(numTilings(1000))  # Output: (Very large number modulo 10^9 + 7)
```

To understand this part of the code:

```python
f[i - 1] = (f[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]) % MOD
```

we need to break it down in the context of the **"tiling a 2 x n board using dominos and trominos" problem**. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

### **Background**
The goal is to calculate the number of ways to completely tile a \( 2 \times n \) board using:
1. **Dominos** (1 x 2 or 2 x 1 tiles).
2. **Trominos** (L-shaped tiles that cover 3 squares).

#### **What is `f[i - 1]`?**
`f[i - 1]` is a helper value that tracks an intermediate state. It represents the number of ways to partially fill a \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board such that there is **one row of the board left incomplete**.

#### **Why is `f[i - 1]` needed?**
When using trominos, we may leave the board in an **incomplete state** (with one row partially filled). To account for such scenarios, the `f` array helps track how many ways we can reach such states.

---

### **The Formula**
```python
f[i - 1] = (f[i - 2] + dp[i - 3]) % MOD
```

This formula calculates the number of ways to leave a \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board in an incomplete state. Here's how the terms contribute:

1. **`f[i - 2]`:**
   - This corresponds to a scenario where we extend an **already incomplete board** (from \( 2 \times (i - 2) \)) using a single **domino tile** to reach an incomplete \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board.

2. **`dp[i - 3]`:**
   - This accounts for a scenario where we start from a completely filled \( 2 \times (i - 3) \) board and place an **L-shaped tromino**. The tromino leaves \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) incomplete with one row remaining.

---

### **Visualization of the Two Cases**
#### Case 1: Extending `f[i - 2]` (Using a Domino)
If \( 2 \times (i - 2) \) is already incomplete:
```
Before:             After:
XXOOOO              XXOOOX
OOXXXX   + domino   OOXXXX
```

#### Case 2: Adding a Tromino to `dp[i - 3]`
If \( 2 \times (i - 3) \) is completely filled:
```
Before:             After:
XXXXXX              XXXXXO
XXXXXX   + tromino  XXXXXO
```

---

### **Key Insight**
`f[i - 1]` accumulates:
1. Ways to extend an already incomplete state (`f[i - 2]`).
2. Ways to start from a fully complete state (`dp[i - 3]`) and transition into an incomplete state.

This intermediate value `f[i - 1]` is then used in the main formula for `dp[i]`:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + 2 * f[i - 1]) % MOD
```

- The `2 * f[i - 1]` term accounts for tiling paths that involve transitioning through incomplete states.

---

### Example Walkthrough (For \( n = 4 \))
1. Initialize:
   - `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 2`.
   - `f[0] = 0`, `f[1] = 0`.

2. For \( i = 3 \):
   - `f[2] = f[1] + dp[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + 2 * f[2] = 2 + 1 + 2 * 1 = 5`.

3. For \( i = 4 \):
   - `f[3] = f[2] + dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] + 2 * f[3] = 5 + 2 + 2 * 2 = 11`.

The value of \( dp[4] = 11 \), which matches the number of ways to tile a \( 2 \times 4 \) board.

---

The term **`2 * f[i - 1]`** appears in the formula for `dp[i]` because **`f[i - 1]` represents incomplete tilings**, and there are **two ways to complete those tilings** (depending on how we place tiles on the remaining row). Let's break this down.

---

### **What does `f[i - 1]` represent?**
`f[i - 1]` tracks the number of ways to tile a \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board **incompletely**, leaving one row unfilled. This incomplete state occurs when:
1. The top row is filled, but the bottom row is incomplete.
   ```
   Before:             After:
   XXXX.....           XXXXXX...
   OOOO.....   →       OOOOO....
   ```
2. The bottom row is filled, but the top row is incomplete.
   ```
   Before:             After:
   XXXX.....           XXXXXX...
   XXXX.....   →       OOOOX....
   ```

When calculating the total ways to tile a \( 2 \times i \) board, we can build upon these incomplete states (`f[i - 1]`) and complete the tiling **in two possible ways**, corresponding to:
- Completing the tiling for the **top row**.
- Completing the tiling for the **bottom row**.

Thus, **`f[i - 1]` contributes twice (once for each row), so it’s multiplied by 2.**

---

### **Visualization of the Two Ways**

Let’s say you’re tiling a \( 2 \times i \) board, and you’ve left the \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board incomplete (tracked by `f[i - 1]`):

#### **Case 1: Completing the Top Row**
To finish the tiling, place a vertical domino on the unfilled square of the top row:
```
Incomplete (f[i - 1]):
XXXXXX....
XXXXXX....
Complete:
XXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXX....
```

#### **Case 2: Completing the Bottom Row**
Alternatively, place a vertical domino on the unfilled square of the bottom row:
```
Incomplete (f[i - 1]):
XXXXXX....
XXXXXX....
Complete:
XXXXXX....
XXXXXXXXXX
```

---

### **Why Multiply by 2?**
Since there are **two distinct ways to complete the tiling** from an incomplete state (`f[i - 1]`), the term is multiplied by 2 to account for both scenarios:
1. Completing the **top row**.
2. Completing the **bottom row**.

---

### **The Full Formula for `dp[i]`**
The total number of ways to tile a \( 2 \times i \) board (`dp[i]`) is calculated as:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + 2 * f[i - 1]) % MOD
```
- **`dp[i - 1]`**: Add a vertical domino to the \( 2 \times (i - 1) \) board.
- **`dp[i - 2]`**: Add two horizontal dominos to the \( 2 \times (i - 2) \) board.
- **`2 * f[i - 1]`**: Accounts for completing the tilings derived from incomplete states.

---

### **Example: \( n = 4 \)**
1. **Base cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 2`.
   - `f[0] = 0`, `f[1] = 0`.

2. **For \( i = 3 \):**
   - `f[2] = f[1] + dp[0] = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + 2 * f[2] = 2 + 1 + 2 * 1 = 5`.

3. **For \( i = 4 \):**
   - `f[3] = f[2] + dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2] + 2 * f[3] = 5 + 2 + 2 * 2 = 11`.

So, \( dp[4] = 11 \), which includes all possible tiling configurations.

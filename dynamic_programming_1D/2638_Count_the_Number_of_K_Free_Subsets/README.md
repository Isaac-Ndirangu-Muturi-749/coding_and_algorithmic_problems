### **Solution Approach:**

The goal is to count the number of subsets of `nums` where no two elements have an absolute difference of `k`. We achieve this using **sorting, grouping by remainder, and dynamic programming**.

---

### **Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Sorting (`O(n log n)`)**
   - We sort `nums` to ensure that we process elements in increasing order. This helps in easily checking the difference condition (`nums[i] - nums[i-1] == k`).

2. **Grouping by Remainder (`O(n)`)**
   - We group numbers based on their remainder when divided by `k`.
   - This ensures that numbers in different groups are completely independent and do not interfere with each other.
   - Example: If `nums = [5, 4, 6]` and `k = 1`, sorting gives `[4, 5, 6]`, and grouping based on `num % k` results in `{0: [4, 5, 6]}`.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Each Group (`O(n)`)**
   - Each group is processed separately.
   - We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid subsets that can be formed using the first `i` elements in the group.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - `dp[0] = 1` (empty subset)
     - `dp[1] = 2` (either pick the first element or don't)
   - **Recurrence Relation:**
     - If `group[i-1] - group[i-2] == k`:
       - We must exclude adjacent elements, so `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.
     - Otherwise:
       - Each element can be included or excluded freely, so `dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 2`.

4. **Final Computation (`O(n)`)**
   - We multiply the results from all remainder groups because they are independent.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**
#### **Input:** `nums = [5,4,6], k = 1`
#### **Sorted:** `[4, 5, 6]`
#### **Grouped by Remainder (mod k = 1):**
   `{0: [4, 5, 6]}` (all numbers fall into one group)

#### **Dynamic Programming Table for `[4, 5, 6]`:**
| `i` | `group[i-1]` | Condition | `dp[i]` Formula | `dp[i]` Value |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | (empty) | - | `1` | 1 |
| 1 | 4 | - | `2` | 2 |
| 2 | 5 | `5-4 == 1` | `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0]` | `3` |
| 3 | 6 | `6-5 == 1` | `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1]` | `5` |

Thus, for group `[4, 5, 6]`, the number of valid k-free subsets is **5**.

#### **Final Answer:** `5`

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**
1. **Sorting `nums`** → `O(n log n)`
2. **Grouping Elements by Remainder** → `O(n)`
3. **Processing Each Group Using DP** → `O(n)`
4. **Final Computation (Multiplication of Subset Counts)** → `O(n)`

### **Overall Complexity:**
Since the dominant term is **sorting (`O(n log n)`)**, the total complexity is **O(n log n)**.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
✅ **Sorting ensures we process elements in increasing order.**
✅ **Grouping by remainder allows independent subset calculations.**
✅ **Dynamic programming efficiently counts valid k-free subsets per group.**
✅ **Final result is the product of subset counts across groups.**


```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countTheNumOfKFreeSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()  # Sort to process elements in increasing order
        remainder_groups = defaultdict(list)

        # Group elements by their remainder when divided by k
        for num in nums:
            remainder_groups[num % k].append(num)

        total_subsets = 1  # Start with the empty subset

        # Process each remainder group independently
        for group in remainder_groups.values():
            group_size = len(group)
            dp = [0] * (group_size + 1)
            dp[0] = 1  # Base case: Empty subset
            dp[1] = 2  # Base case: Either take the first element or don't

            # Dynamic programming to count valid k-Free subsets
            for i in range(2, group_size + 1):
                if group[i - 1] - group[i - 2] == k:
                    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]  # Exclude adjacent elements with difference k
                else:
                    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * 2  # Each element can be included or excluded independently

            total_subsets *= dp[group_size]  # Multiply results for independent groups

        return total_subsets
```

---

This is an **optimized approach** to count the number of `k`-Free subsets using **Dynamic Programming and Grouping by Modulo k**. Below is a **detailed breakdown** of how this solution works.

---

## **Understanding the Solution**
### **Step 1: Sorting the Array**
```python
nums.sort()
```
Sorting the array ensures that we process elements in ascending order, making it easier to check for `k`-differences.

---

### **Step 2: Grouping Elements by Their Remainder mod k**
```python
g = defaultdict(list)
for x in nums:
    g[x % k].append(x)
```
- The key observation is that elements with the **same remainder when divided by k** form **independent groups**.
- This allows us to break the problem into **smaller independent subproblems**.

#### **Example**
**Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 5, 8]`, `k = 5`
**After sorting:** `[2, 3, 5, 8]`
- Grouping by remainder when divided by `k = 5`:
  ```
  g[2] -> [2]   (2 % 5 = 2)
  g[3] -> [3]   (3 % 5 = 3)
  g[0] -> [5]   (5 % 5 = 0)
  g[3] -> [3, 8] (8 % 5 = 3)
  ```
  - Final groups:
    ```
    g = {2: [2], 3: [3, 8], 0: [5]}
    ```

---

### **Step 3: Using Dynamic Programming for Each Group**
```python
ans = 1
for arr in g.values():
    m = len(arr)
    f = [0] * (m + 1)
    f[0] = 1
    f[1] = 2
```
Each group is processed **separately**.
- `f[i]` represents the number of ways to form `k`-free subsets using the first `i` elements of the group.
- **Base cases:**
  - `f[0] = 1` (only the empty subset)
  - `f[1] = 2` (either pick the first element or don't pick it)

---

### **Step 4: DP Transition Formula**
```python
for i in range(2, m + 1):
    if arr[i - 1] - arr[i - 2] == k:
        f[i] = f[i - 1] + f[i - 2]  # Fibonacci-like recurrence
    else:
        f[i] = f[i - 1] * 2  # Each element can be picked or not independently
```
- If **adjacent elements differ by k**, then we **either**:
  - Take the current element → Must exclude the previous one (f[i-2])
  - Skip the current element (f[i-1])
  - This follows **Fibonacci recurrence** `f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]`.

- If they **do not differ by k**, then we have **2 choices for each element** (take or not take):
  ```
  f[i] = f[i-1] * 2
  ```

---

### **Step 5: Multiply DP Results for Each Group**
```python
ans *= f[m]
```
- Since groups are independent, we **multiply** results across groups to get the final answer.

---

## **Complexity Analysis**
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Grouping by k**: `O(n)`
- **DP Processing for Each Group**: `O(n)`, worst case if `nums` has one large group.
- **Overall Complexity**: **O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n)**

---

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Example 1**
**Input:**
```python
nums = [5,4,6]
k = 1
```
**Step 1: Sorting**
```
nums = [4, 5, 6]
```
**Step 2: Grouping by Modulo k**
```
g = {0: [4, 5, 6]}  # (4%1 = 0, 5%1 = 0, 6%1 = 0)
```
**Step 3: DP Processing**
```
m = 3, arr = [4,5,6]
f[0] = 1
f[1] = 2
f[2] = f[1] + f[0] = 2 + 1 = 3
f[3] = f[2] + f[1] = 3 + 2 = 5
```
**Final Answer:** `5`

---

### **Example 2**
**Input:**
```python
nums = [2,3,5,8], k = 5
```
**Step 1: Sorting**
```
nums = [2, 3, 5, 8]
```
**Step 2: Grouping by Modulo k**
```
g = {2: [2], 3: [3, 8], 0: [5]}
```
**Step 3: DP Processing**
- **Group `[2]`**
  - `f[0] = 1, f[1] = 2`
  - Answer: `2`
- **Group `[3, 8]`**
  - `f[0] = 1, f[1] = 2`
  - `f[2] = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - Answer: `4`
- **Group `[5]`**
  - `f[0] = 1, f[1] = 2`
  - Answer: `2`
- **Final Answer:**
  ```
  2 * 4 * 2 = 12
  ```

---

## **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Sorting & Grouping simplify the problem.**
✅ **DP efficiently counts k-Free subsets in each group.**
✅ **Multiplication combines independent groups.**
✅ **Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`, scalable for large inputs.**

The **dynamic programming (DP) approach** used in this solution is based on counting **k-free subsets** for each remainder group independently.

---

### **Understanding the DP Approach**
We process each **remainder group** separately using **dynamic programming (DP)**.

#### **1. What is a k-Free Subset?**
A subset is **k-free** if **no two elements differ by exactly `k`**.

#### **2. Why Use DP?**
We need to count **all valid subsets** while ensuring that numbers with a difference of `k` are not included together.

---

### **Breaking Down the DP Table**
For a given remainder group `group = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]` (sorted in increasing order):

- **Define `dp[i]`**: The number of valid subsets that can be formed using the first `i` elements.
- **Base Cases**:
  - `dp[0] = 1`: The empty subset.
  - `dp[1] = 2`: Either take the first element or don't.

- **Recurrence Relation**:
  - If `group[i-1] - group[i-2] == k` (adjacent numbers differ by `k`):
    - We can either **exclude** `group[i-1]` (use `dp[i-1]`) or **include** it (use `dp[i-2]` but exclude `group[i-2]`).
    - **Formula:**
      \[
      dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
      \]
  - Otherwise (adjacent numbers **do not** differ by `k`):
    - Every element can be **either included or not**, effectively doubling the count.
    - **Formula:**
      \[
      dp[i] = dp[i-1] \times 2
      \]

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Given Input:**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 8]
k = 2
```
#### **Step 1: Group Elements by `num % k`**
Grouping by remainder when divided by `k = 2`:
```python
remainder_groups = {
    1: [1, 3, 5],  # All numbers where num % 2 == 1
    0: [2, 6, 8]   # All numbers where num % 2 == 0
}
```

Each group is processed **separately** using DP.

---

### **Processing Group `[1, 3, 5]`**
Since the difference between consecutive elements is `k = 2`, we use:

- **Base cases**:
  - `dp[0] = 1` (empty subset)
  - `dp[1] = 2` (either take `1` or don't)

- **Filling DP Table**:
  - `dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`

Thus, **total subsets for this group** = `dp[3] = 5`.

---

### **Processing Group `[2, 6, 8]`**
- **Base cases**:
  - `dp[0] = 1`
  - `dp[1] = 2`

- **Filling DP Table**:
  - `dp[2] = dp[1] * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4` (since `6 - 2 ≠ 2`, elements are independent)
  - `dp[3] = dp[2] * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8` (since `8 - 6 ≠ 2`)

Thus, **total subsets for this group** = `dp[3] = 8`.

---

### **Final Calculation**
```python
total_subsets = 5 * 8 = 40
```
Thus, the final answer is **40**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Sorting ensures** we process numbers in order.
2. **Dividing into remainder groups** allows independent processing.
3. **Using DP**, we efficiently count subsets while ensuring k-free conditions:
   - If `group[i-1] - group[i-2] == k`, use **Fibonacci-like recurrence** (`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`).
   - Otherwise, elements are **independent**, so we double (`dp[i] = dp[i-1] * 2`).
4. **Multiply results for all remainder groups** to get the final count.

### **Why Do Remainder Groups Work in This Problem?**

The key reason **remainder groups** work is that elements **in different remainder groups never interact** when considering the **k-free** condition. This allows us to split the problem into independent subproblems.

---

### **Understanding the Core Idea**
We are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. A subset is **k-free** if it does **not contain two elements that differ by exactly `k`**.

Since numbers that differ by `k` have the same remainder when divided by `k`, we can **group numbers by their remainder** when divided by `k`. This way:
- Any two numbers in **different remainder groups** can always be included together in a subset.
- Any conflicts (where elements differ by exactly `k`) **only happen within the same remainder group**.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example Input**
```python
nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 8]
k = 2
```
#### **Step 1: Compute Remainder Groups**
We compute `num % k` for each number:
```python
1 % 2 = 1
3 % 2 = 1
5 % 2 = 1
2 % 2 = 0
6 % 2 = 0
8 % 2 = 0
```
Now, we **group numbers based on their remainder**:
```python
remainder_groups = {
    1: [1, 3, 5],  # All numbers where num % 2 == 1
    0: [2, 6, 8]   # All numbers where num % 2 == 0
}
```
---

### **Step 2: Why Can We Solve Each Group Independently?**
1. **Numbers in different remainder groups** (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]` vs. `[2, 6, 8]`) **never conflict** because they **can never differ by exactly `k`**.
   - Example: `1` (remainder 1) and `2` (remainder 0) differ by `1`, not `k=2`, so they **do not interfere**.
   - This means we can **count subsets for each group separately** and **multiply** their results at the end.

2. **Numbers inside the same remainder group** **may conflict**.
   - Example: In `[1, 3, 5]`, `3 - 1 = 2` (which is `k`), so we **cannot include both `1` and `3` in the same subset**.
   - This is why we use **dynamic programming (DP)** within each remainder group.

---

### **Step 3: Why Does This Help?**
- **Splitting into remainder groups makes the problem smaller**. Instead of solving one big problem, we solve smaller independent problems.
- **We can use DP separately for each group**, making the logic **simpler and more efficient**.

---

### **Step 4: How Remainder Groups Avoid Mistakes**
Let's see what would happen if we **did not** group by remainder.

#### **Incorrect Approach: Treating All Numbers Together**
If we tried to handle `[1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 8]` as a single sequence:
- We would struggle to decide which numbers to exclude due to the `k` constraint.
- The **state transitions would be more complex** because we would need to check every number against every other number.

#### **Correct Approach: Using Remainder Groups**
- **Group `[1, 3, 5]` separately** and apply DP only to it.
- **Group `[2, 6, 8]` separately** and apply DP only to it.
- **Multiply the results** from each group because their subsets do not interfere.

This **simplifies** the problem significantly.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Grouping by remainder ensures numbers that could conflict (differ by `k`) are in the same group**.
✅ **Numbers in different remainder groups never interfere**, allowing us to solve subproblems independently.
✅ **Each remainder group follows a simpler DP pattern** where we can handle conflicts only within the group.
✅ **Final result is the product of the results from each group**, since subsets from different groups are independent.

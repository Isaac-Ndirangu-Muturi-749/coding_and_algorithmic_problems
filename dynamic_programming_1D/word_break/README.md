To solve this problem, we can use **dynamic programming**. The idea is to check if the string `s` can be broken down into words found in `wordDict`.

### Approach:
We create a boolean array `dp` of size `n+1` (where `n` is the length of `s`), where `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a boolean array `dp` of size `n+1` with `dp[0] = True`. This is because an empty string can always be segmented (base case).
2. Iterate over the string `s`, and for each index `i`, check if there is any word in `wordDict` that matches the substring `s[j:i]` where `j < i` and `dp[j] == True`. If there is such a match, set `dp[i] = True`.
3. Finally, return `dp[n]`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This will indicate whether the entire string can be segmented.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: list[str]) -> bool:
        word_set = set(wordDict)  # Using a set for O(1) look-up time
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # Base case: empty string can always be segmented

        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break  # No need to check further once dp[i] is True

        return dp[len(s)]
```

### Explanation:
- **word_set**: We convert `wordDict` to a set to allow O(1) lookups, which speeds up the algorithm.
- **dp[i]**: Tracks whether the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented.
- For each index `i` in `s`, we check all possible substrings `s[j:i]` where `0 ≤ j < i` and check if:
  1. `dp[j]` is `True`, meaning the substring `s[0:j]` can be segmented.
  2. `s[j:i]` is in the `word_set`, meaning it can be found in the dictionary.

If both conditions hold, we mark `dp[i]` as `True` and move on. Finally, we return `dp[len(s)]`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `s = "leetcode"`, `wordDict = ["leet", "code"]`
- **dp Array**:
  - `dp[0] = True` (base case)
  - `dp[4] = True` (since `"leet"` is in `wordDict`)
  - `dp[8] = True` (since `"code"` is in `wordDict` and `dp[4]` is `True`)
- **Output**: `True`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `s = "applepenapple"`, `wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]`
- **dp Array**:
  - `dp[0] = True` (base case)
  - `dp[5] = True` (since `"apple"` is in `wordDict`)
  - `dp[8] = True` (since `"pen"` is in `wordDict`)
  - `dp[13] = True` (since `"apple"` is in `wordDict`)
- **Output**: `True`

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `s = "catsandog"`, `wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]`
- **dp Array**:
  - `dp[0] = True` (base case)
  - `dp[3] = True` (since `"cat"` is in `wordDict`)
  - `dp[4] = True` (since `"cats"` is in `wordDict`)
  - There is no valid segmentation for `"sandog"`.
- **Output**: `False`

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of `s`. We are iterating through all possible substrings of `s` and checking them against the word dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, as we are using the `dp` array.

This approach efficiently solves the problem while ensuring that the solution is optimized using dynamic programming.


Let’s break down the `wordBreak` function step-by-step using the example:

### Example
**Input:**
- `s = "leetcode"`
- `wordDict = ["leet", "code"]`

### Function Breakdown

1. **Initialization:**
   - Convert `wordDict` to a set for efficient look-up:
     ```python
     word_set = {"leet", "code"}
     ```
   - Create a `dp` list initialized to `False`, with the size of `len(s) + 1`:
     ```python
     dp = [False] * 8  # Since len("leetcode") is 8
     dp[0] = True      # Base case: empty string can be segmented
     ```
   - `dp` now looks like:
     ```
     dp = [True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]
     ```

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `len(s)` (inclusive):
     ```python
     for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):  # i will take values from 1 to 8
     ```

3. **Inner Loop to Check Segmentation:**
   - For each `i`, the inner loop checks all possible `j` from `0` to `i-1`:
     ```python
     for j in range(i):
     ```

### Iteration Details

**Iteration 1: i = 1**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:1]` is `"l"`, which is not in `word_set`.
- Result: `dp[1]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 2: i = 2**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:2]` is `"le"`, not in `word_set`.
- `j = 1`:
  - `dp[1]` is `False`, so skip.
- Result: `dp[2]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 3: i = 3**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:3]` is `"lee"`, not in `word_set`.
- `j = 1`:
  - `dp[1]` is `False`, so skip.
- `j = 2`:
  - `dp[2]` is `False`, so skip.
- Result: `dp[3]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 4: i = 4**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:4]` is `"leet"`, which is in `word_set`.
  - Set `dp[4]` to `True` and break.
- `dp` now looks like:
  ```
  dp = [True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False]
  ```

**Iteration 5: i = 5**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:5]` is `"leetc"`, not in `word_set`.
- `j = 1`:
  - `dp[1]` is `False`, so skip.
- `j = 2`:
  - `dp[2]` is `False`, so skip.
- `j = 3`:
  - `dp[3]` is `False`, so skip.
- `j = 4`:
  - `dp[4]` is `True`, and `s[4:5]` is `"c"`, not in `word_set`.
- Result: `dp[5]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 6: i = 6**
- Similar checks yield `dp[6]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 7: i = 7**
- Check for `i = 7` results in `dp[7]` remains `False`.

**Iteration 8: i = 8**
- `j = 0`:
  - `dp[0]` is `True`, and `s[0:8]` is `"leetcode"`, not in `word_set`.
- `j = 1` to `j = 6` checks result in no new updates.
- `j = 4`:
  - `dp[4]` is `True`, and `s[4:8]` is `"code"`, which is in `word_set`.
  - Set `dp[8]` to `True` and break.
- Final `dp` looks like:
  ```
  dp = [True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, True]
  ```

### Result
- Return `dp[len(s)]`, which is `dp[8]`, and it is `True`.

Thus, the output of the function for this example is `True`, indicating that the string `"leetcode"` can be segmented into words found in the dictionary.

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`. Here's how we can implement the solution:

### Explanation:
- We want to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers chosen from the range `[1, n]`.
- For each combination, we can start with an empty combination and iteratively add numbers to it, ensuring that the next number added is greater than the last one (to avoid duplicates).
- Backtracking is an efficient way to explore all possibilities, where we try to form a valid combination and backtrack when we have either formed a valid combination or exhausted possibilities.

### Algorithm:
1. Use a recursive helper function to explore combinations.
2. The base case for the recursion is when the current combination has `k` numbers, in which case it should be added to the result list.
3. In each recursive call, try adding numbers from the current number up to `n` and recurse.

Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def backtrack(start, comb):
            # If the combination is of the right length, add it to the results
            if len(comb) == k:
                result.append(comb[:])
                return

            # Iterate through the range and explore combinations
            for i in range(start, n + 1):
                # Add i into the combination
                comb.append(i)
                # Recurse by exploring further with i + 1
                backtrack(i + 1, comb)
                # Backtrack: remove the last added element
                comb.pop()

        result = []
        backtrack(1, [])
        return result
```

### Example Usage:

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.combine(4, 2))  # Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
print(solution.combine(1, 1))  # Output: [[1]]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **`combine(n, k)`**: This function initializes the result list and starts the backtracking process from the number `1`.
- **`backtrack(start, comb)`**: This is the recursive helper function.
  - If the current combination `comb` has a length of `k`, we add it to the result list.
  - Otherwise, we loop from the current `start` number to `n`, try adding each number to the current combination `comb`, and recursively call `backtrack()` to explore further.
  - After exploring, we remove the last number from the combination (backtrack) and continue.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is approximately \(O(C(n, k))\), where \(C(n, k)\) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n`.

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds solutions to a problem by exploring all possible options, and abandons ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the current option cannot lead to a valid solution. It is particularly useful for problems that require searching through a large number of possible configurations or combinations, such as puzzles, permutations, or constraint satisfaction problems.

### Key Concepts of Backtracking:

1. **Exploration of Possible Solutions**:
   - Backtracking involves exploring all potential solutions by making a sequence of decisions. Each decision expands the solution step-by-step.
   - If the solution is valid, the algorithm continues to the next step.
   - If it becomes clear that the solution will not work (i.e., violates some condition or constraint), the algorithm abandons that branch and returns to the previous step (backtracks) to try a different path.

2. **Recursive Nature**:
   - Backtracking is typically implemented using recursion. Each recursive call represents a step in the solution-building process.
   - After exploring one possible decision, the function returns (backtracks) to explore other decisions at the same level.

3. **Pruning (Early Termination)**:
   - Backtracking often incorporates pruning. This means that if at any point it becomes clear that the current partial solution cannot lead to a valid solution, the algorithm stops exploring further from that point.
   - Pruning significantly reduces the number of possibilities to be checked.

4. **Search Space**:
   - The "search space" is the set of all possible configurations that need to be explored. Backtracking tries to navigate through this space by choosing and un-choosing decisions recursively.

### Backtracking Example

#### Example: Solving a Maze

Let’s take an example of solving a maze where we want to find a path from the start to the exit. Each step in the maze can be represented as a recursive choice of moving left, right, up, or down. If at any step you hit a wall or go out of bounds, you backtrack to the previous step and try a different path.

### Basic Steps in Backtracking:
1. **Choose**: Make a choice by moving in one direction.
2. **Explore**: Recursively explore further by making another choice.
3. **Un-choose** (Backtrack): If the current path leads to a dead-end, backtrack and try a different choice.

### Pseudocode for Backtracking:

```python
def backtrack(current_state):
    if current_state is a solution:
        add current_state to result
        return

    for each choice in current_state:
        if choice is valid:
            make the choice
            backtrack(new_state)  # Explore further with the choice
            undo the choice  # Backtrack and try other options
```

### Example: N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem is a classic example of backtracking. The goal is to place `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

Steps in Backtracking for the N-Queens problem:
1. **Choose**: Try placing a queen in each column of the current row.
2. **Explore**: Recursively move to the next row and try placing a queen again.
3. **Backtrack**: If placing a queen in the current column violates any rule, remove the queen and try the next column.

```python
def solve_n_queens(row, board):
    if row == n:  # All queens are placed
        add_solution(board)
        return

    for col in range(n):
        if is_safe(row, col, board):
            place_queen(row, col, board)  # Choose
            solve_n_queens(row + 1, board)  # Explore
            remove_queen(row, col, board)  # Un-choose (Backtrack)
```

### Applications of Backtracking:
1. **Constraint satisfaction problems**: Sudoku, N-Queens problem, crossword puzzles.
2. **Combinatorial problems**: Permutations, combinations, and subsets generation.
3. **Optimization problems**: Finding the optimal solution in games or search spaces.

### Key Points:
- **Backtracking** is about trying all possibilities and backtracking when you hit a dead-end.
- It is **recursive** and **systematic**, ensuring that all potential solutions are explored without redundancy.
- It leverages **pruning** to avoid unnecessary exploration of paths that can't lead to valid solutions.

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Backtracking are both algorithmic techniques used to explore search spaces, but they have different objectives and are applied in different contexts. Here’s a comparison to help clarify their differences and relationships:

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Purpose**:
- DFS is a fundamental graph traversal technique. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

**Key Characteristics**:
1. **Traversal Mechanism**: DFS traverses nodes by exploring each branch deeply before moving on to the next branch.
2. **Data Structure**: Typically uses a stack (either explicitly or via recursion).
3. **Applications**:
   - Traversing or searching in graphs and trees.
   - Pathfinding problems where all possible paths need to be explored.
   - Solving puzzles and games where you need to visit all possible states.

**Steps**:
1. Start from a root node (or any node in the graph).
2. Explore each adjacent node (or child node) by moving deeper into the tree/graph.
3. If you reach a node with no unvisited children, backtrack to the previous node and continue.
4. Repeat until all nodes have been visited or the target is found.

**Example**:
- **Graph Traversal**: To visit all nodes in a graph, DFS would start from one node, explore as far as possible, and then backtrack to explore other nodes.

### Backtracking

**Purpose**:
- Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used to build solutions incrementally and discard solutions that fail to meet the criteria at any step. It’s particularly useful for problems involving combinations, permutations, and constraint satisfaction.

**Key Characteristics**:
1. **Solution Building**: Builds solutions incrementally and abandons (backtracks) when a partial solution is determined to be invalid.
2. **Data Structure**: Uses recursion and usually an implicit stack.
3. **Applications**:
   - Solving constraint satisfaction problems (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens).
   - Finding all possible combinations or permutations of elements.
   - Solving optimization problems where feasible solutions need to be explored.

**Steps**:
1. **Choose**: Make a decision or move (e.g., place a queen on a chessboard).
2. **Explore**: Recursively attempt to build on this decision.
3. **Backtrack**: If the current path fails to lead to a valid solution, undo the last decision and try a different option.

**Example**:
- **N-Queens Problem**: Place queens on a chessboard one by one. If a conflict arises (i.e., a queen is placed in a position that threatens another), remove the queen (backtrack) and try a different position.

### Comparison:

1. **Objective**:
   - **DFS**: Used for traversing and exploring nodes in a graph or tree.
   - **Backtracking**: Used for solving problems by incrementally building solutions and undoing when constraints are violated.

2. **Use Case**:


   - **DFS**: General traversal of structures like trees and graphs.
   - **Backtracking**: Problem-solving involving constraints and combinatorial search.

3. **Exploration**:
   - **DFS**: Continues deep into each branch of the graph or tree.
   - **Backtracking**: Makes a decision, explores further, and backtracks if the decision leads to a failure or invalid state.

4. **Termination**:
   - **DFS**: Terminates when all nodes are visited or when a specific target is found.
   - **Backtracking**: Terminates when a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

### Relationship:
- **Backtracking** can be seen as a specialized form of DFS applied to specific problems where decisions are incrementally built and validated. In fact, backtracking often uses DFS as its underlying method to explore potential solutions and backtrack when constraints are violated.

In summary, DFS is a broader traversal method used to explore graphs and trees, while backtracking is a problem-solving approach that can utilize DFS to incrementally build and validate solutions.


Let’s walk through the process for `combine(4, 3)` step by step. Here, we want to generate all combinations of 3 numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

### Initial Setup

1. **Function Call**: `combine(4, 3)`
   - **Goal**: Generate all combinations of 3 numbers from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

2. **Initialize**:
   - `result` is an empty list to store the final combinations.
   - Call `backtrack(start=1, comb=[])` to begin the backtracking process.

### Backtracking Steps

#### First Level of Recursion (`start=1`):

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 3**:
     - Add `3` to `comb`: `comb = [1, 2, 3]`
     - Since `comb` has length `k` (3), add `[1, 2, 3]` to `result`: `result = [[1, 2, 3]]`
     - Backtrack: remove `3` from `comb`: `comb = [1, 2]`

   - **i = 4**:
     - Add `4` to `comb`: `comb = [1, 2, 4]`
     - Since `comb` has length `k` (3), add `[1, 2, 4]` to `result`: `result = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]]`
     - Backtrack: remove `4` from `comb`: `comb = [1, 2]`

3. Backtrack: remove `2` from `comb`: `comb = [1]`

#### Second Level of Recursion Continued (`start=3`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = [1]`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 3**:

     - Add `4` to `comb`: `comb = [1, 3, 4]`
     - Since `comb` has length `k` (3), add `[1, 3, 4]` to `result`: `result = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4]]`
     - Backtrack: remove `4` from `comb`: `comb = [1, 3]`

3. Backtrack: remove `3` from `comb`: `comb = [1]`

4. Backtrack: remove `1` from `comb`: `comb = []`

#### First Level of Recursion Continued (`start=2`):

   - **i = 2**:
     - Add `2` to `comb`: `comb = [2]`
     - Recurse with `backtrack(start=3, comb=[2])`

#### Second Level of Recursion (`start=3`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = [2]`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 3**:
     - Add `3` to `comb`: `comb = [2, 3]`
     - Recurse with `backtrack(start=4, comb=[2, 3])`

#### Third Level of Recursion (`start=4`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = [2, 3]`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 4**:
     - Add `4` to `comb`: `comb = [2, 3, 4]`
     - Since `comb` has length `k` (3), add `[2, 3, 4]` to `result`: `result = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]`
     - Backtrack: remove `4` from `comb`: `comb = [2, 3]`

#### First Level of Recursion Continued (`start=3`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = []`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 3**:
     - Add `3` to `comb`: `comb = [3]`
     - Recurse with `backtrack(start=4, comb=[3])`

#### Second Level of Recursion (`start=4`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = [3]`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 4**:
     - Add `4` to `comb`: `comb = [3, 4]`
     - There are no further elements to add, and the combination has only 2 elements, so we backtrack without adding anything to the result.
     - Backtrack: remove `4` from `comb`: `comb = [3]`

3. Backtrack: remove `3` from `comb`: `comb = []`

#### First Level of Recursion Continued (`start=4`):

1. **Current Combination**: `comb = []`

2. **Iteration**:
   - **i = 4**:
     - Add `4` to `comb`: `comb = [4]`
     - There are no further elements to add, and the combination has only 1 element, so we backtrack without adding anything to the result.
     - Backtrack: remove `4` from `comb`: `comb = []`

### Final Result

After completing all recursive calls and backtracking, the final `result` list contains all the combinations of length `k`:

```python
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]
```

The function `combine(4, 3)` returns this result.

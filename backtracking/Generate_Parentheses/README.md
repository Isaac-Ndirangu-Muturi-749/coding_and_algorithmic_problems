To generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given `n`, we can use **backtracking**. The idea is to recursively build strings of parentheses while ensuring that at any point, the number of closing parentheses does not exceed the number of opening parentheses. This guarantees that the parentheses string is valid (i.e., well-formed).

### Approach:
- Use a recursive function to add either an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)` at each step.
- Track how many opening and closing parentheses have been used.
- We can only add an opening parenthesis if the count of opening parentheses used is less than `n`.
- We can only add a closing parenthesis if the count of closing parentheses used is less than the number of opening parentheses used.

### Steps:
1. **Base case**: When both the opening and closing parentheses counts reach `n`, we have a valid string, so add it to the result list.
2. **Recursive case**:
   - Add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used all of them yet.
   - Add a closing parenthesis if we have used fewer closing than opening parentheses.

### Code Implementation (Python):

```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []

        # Helper function for backtracking
        def backtrack(current_string, open_count, close_count):
            # If the current string has reached the maximum length, add it to the result
            if len(current_string) == 2 * n:
                result.append(current_string)
                return

            # Add '(' if we still have available '(' to add
            if open_count < n:
                backtrack(current_string + '(', open_count + 1, close_count)

            # Add ')' if there are more '(' used than ')' (to maintain valid parentheses)
            if close_count < open_count:
                backtrack(current_string + ')', open_count, close_count + 1)

        # Start the backtracking process with an empty string and 0 open/close counts
        backtrack('', 0, 0)
        return result
```

### Explanation:
1. We define a helper function `backtrack` that takes three arguments:
   - `current_string`: the current string of parentheses being formed.
   - `open_count`: the number of opening parentheses used so far.
   - `close_count`: the number of closing parentheses used so far.

2. **Base Case**: When the length of the `current_string` is equal to `2 * n` (i.e., we've used all `n` opening and `n` closing parentheses), we add this string to the result list.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - If `open_count < n`, we add an opening parenthesis `(` and recursively call the `backtrack` function.
   - If `close_count < open_count`, we add a closing parenthesis `)` and recursively call the `backtrack` function.

4. The recursion continues until all valid strings are generated and stored in `result`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `n = 3`
- **Output**: `["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]`

The function will generate strings of length `6` (since `2 * 3 = 6`), ensuring that at each point, the string remains valid.

1. `((()))`: The function first tries adding as many opening parentheses as possible, then fills in the closing parentheses.
2. `(()())`: The function backtracks and tries different configurations by placing closing parentheses earlier.
3. `...`: The process continues until all valid combinations are found.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `n = 1`
- **Output**: `["()"]`

Only one valid combination exists, which is simply `()`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(4^n / sqrt(n)). This is a known result for generating well-formed parentheses, as the number of valid strings grows exponentially with `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(4^n / sqrt(n)), considering the space needed for the recursive call stack and storing all the valid combinations.

### Summary:
This approach leverages backtracking to explore all possible valid combinations of parentheses by ensuring each string is well-formed as it is constructed. The recursion is terminated early when invalid strings are detected (i.e., too many closing parentheses).


Let’s break down the `generateParenthesis` function with `n = 3` to understand how backtracking works step by step.

### Problem Explanation:
The goal is to generate all combinations of `n` pairs of valid parentheses. For `n = 3`, the function should return combinations like `["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]`.

### How Backtracking Works:

#### Step 1: Initialization
- The function `generateParenthesis` starts by initializing an empty list `result` to store the valid combinations of parentheses.
- It defines a helper function `backtrack` that performs the actual work of generating parentheses.
- `backtrack` starts with an empty string `current_string` and two counters:
  - `open_count` for counting how many `'('` have been added.
  - `close_count` for counting how many `')'` have been added.

#### Step 2: Backtracking Logic
The backtracking function follows these key rules:
1. **Base case**: If the `current_string` reaches a length of `2 * n` (i.e., it contains `n` opening and `n` closing parentheses), it's a valid combination and is added to the `result` list.
2. **Adding an opening parenthesis `'('`**: If `open_count` is less than `n`, it means we can still add more opening parentheses. So we make a recursive call, adding `'('` to `current_string` and incrementing `open_count`.
3. **Adding a closing parenthesis `')'`**: If `close_count` is less than `open_count`, we can add a closing parenthesis, ensuring that parentheses are balanced. So, we make another recursive call, adding `')'` to `current_string` and incrementing `close_count`.

#### Step 3: Recursion Example (n = 3)
Here’s what happens during the backtracking for `n = 3`:

1. **Start with `current_string = ""` (empty string)**:
   - Add `'('` since `open_count < n` → `current_string = "("`, `open_count = 1`, `close_count = 0`.

2. **Add another `'('`** since `open_count < n`:
   - `current_string = "(("`, `open_count = 2`, `close_count = 0`.

3. **Add another `'('`**:
   - `current_string = "((("`, `open_count = 3`, `close_count = 0`.

4. **Cannot add more `'('` because `open_count == n`**, so add `')'` since `close_count < open_count`:
   - `current_string = "((()"`, `open_count = 3`, `close_count = 1`.

5. **Add another `')'`**:
   - `current_string = "((())"`, `open_count = 3`, `close_count = 2`.

6. **Add another `')'`**:
   - `current_string = "((()))"`, `open_count = 3`, `close_count = 3`.
   - Now, `current_string` is of length `6` (i.e., `2 * n`), so it’s a valid combination and is added to the `result`.

7. **Backtrack**: The function then backtracks to previous recursive calls to explore other possible valid combinations:
   - It tries adding a `')'` earlier in different positions to generate combinations like `"(()())"`, `"(())()"`, `"()(())"`, and `"()()()"`.

Here’s how the recursive calls explore all possibilities:

- After `((()))` is found, it backtracks to explore possibilities like `"(()())"`, where a `')'` is added earlier.
- Then it finds other combinations by backtracking further:
  - `(())()`
  - `()(())`
  - `()()()`

### Visualization for `n = 3`:
The recursive tree would look something like this:

```
                ""
               /  \
              (    -
            ((      -
          (((       (
         ((()        ()
        ((())       ()(
       ((()))      ()()
       (()())    ()(())
      (())()     ()()()
```

Each path from the root (`""`) to a leaf corresponds to a valid combination of parentheses.

### Summary of How Backtracking Works:
- **Recursive exploration**: The function explores all possible placements of `'('` and `')'` by making recursive calls.
- **Backtracking**: After exploring one complete path (like `"((()))"`), it backtracks to try other combinations (like `"(()())"`).
- **Constraints enforcement**: By keeping track of `open_count` and `close_count`, the function ensures that only valid combinations of parentheses are generated.

This ensures that all valid combinations of `n` pairs of parentheses are explored and added to `result`.


Let's walk through the tree representation of backtracking for generating valid parentheses when `n = 3`. Each node in the tree represents a step in forming a valid string of parentheses by adding either `'('` (an opening parenthesis) or `')'` (a closing parenthesis). The recursive process explores every possible path to form valid combinations, and the backtracking mechanism ensures we only build valid sequences.

### Tree Breakdown for `n = 3`

The goal is to build all valid combinations of 3 pairs of parentheses. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the tree:

1. **Start with an empty string `""`:**
   - At the root, the string is empty. We have two options: we can either add `'('` (opening parenthesis) or do nothing (represented by `-` in the diagram, meaning we don't go that way because there is no valid path).

```
                ""
               /
              (
```

2. **Add `'('`:**
   - We add one `'('` to form `"("`. Now we have 2 opening parentheses left to use and 3 closing parentheses.
   - We can either add another `'('` or add `')'` later when valid.

```
               "("
              /
            ((
```

3. **Add another `'('`:**
   - After adding a second `'('`, we have `"((`". Now 1 opening parenthesis remains, and we still need 3 closing parentheses.
   - We can still add another `'('` (since we have 1 left), but not a `')'` yet (because the number of closing parentheses must be less than or equal to the number of opening parentheses in a valid sequence).

```
             "((("
            /
          (((
```

4. **Add the final `'('`:**
   - We add the last `'('`, resulting in `"((("`. Now we have no opening parentheses left, and we need to add 3 closing parentheses to balance the sequence.
   - The only option now is to add a `')'`.

```
            "((()"
           /
         ((()
```

5. **Start adding `')'`:**
   - We add one `')'`, resulting in `"((()"`. Now we need 2 more closing parentheses to balance the sequence.
   - We can add another `')'`.

```
         "((())"
        /
      ((())
```

6. **Continue adding `')'`:**
   - We add a second `')'`, resulting in `"((())"`. Now we need 1 more closing parenthesis to balance the sequence.

```
       "((()))"
```

7. **Complete the sequence:**
   - Adding the final `')'` gives us `"((()))"`. This is a valid combination, and it gets added to the result list.
   - Once this path is fully explored, the function backtracks to explore other valid sequences.

Now let’s see how backtracking works to generate other valid combinations.

### Backtracking to Explore Other Paths

Once `"((()))"` is found, the function backtracks and explores other ways to form valid combinations by adding closing parentheses (`')'`) earlier in the sequence.

#### Path 2: Exploring `"(()())"`
- After backtracking, we add `')'` earlier instead of continuing to add `'('` all the way to the end:
  1. After two opening parentheses, add a closing parenthesis to get `"(()"`.
  2. Add an opening parenthesis to get `"(()("`, then balance it by adding two more closing parentheses to get `"(()())"`.

```
       (()())
```

#### Path 3: Exploring `"(())()"`
- Similarly, by backtracking, we can generate other combinations:
  1. Add two opening parentheses to get `"(())"`.
  2. Add a closing parenthesis, then balance the sequence to get `"(())()"`.

```
      (())()
```

#### Path 4: Exploring `"()(())"`
- Backtrack further to explore sequences like `"()(())"`, where we add a closing parenthesis after the first opening parenthesis.

```
     ()(())
```

#### Path 5: Exploring `"()()()"`
- Finally, we can also generate `"()()()"` by alternating between adding opening and closing parentheses.

```
    ()()()
```

### Summary of Tree Structure

The tree structure illustrates how backtracking explores every possible path:

```
                ""
               /
              (
            ((
          (((
         ((()
        ((())
       ((()))

After backtracking:
       (()())
      (())()
     ()(())
    ()()()
```

Each complete path in this tree represents a valid combination of 3 pairs of parentheses, and the backtracking algorithm ensures that all possibilities are explored while adhering to the constraints for valid parentheses.

### Why Backtracking Works:
- **Exploration**: Backtracking allows the function to explore all valid ways to place parentheses.
- **Pruning**: When the string becomes invalid (like when there are more closing than opening parentheses), the function stops further exploration down that path.
- **Base Case**: When the length of the string reaches `2 * n`, it ensures the string contains exactly `n` opening and `n` closing parentheses, so it's valid and added to the result.

This process guarantees that all valid combinations of parentheses are generated!

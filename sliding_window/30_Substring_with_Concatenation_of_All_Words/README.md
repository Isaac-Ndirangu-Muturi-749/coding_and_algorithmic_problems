To solve this problem, we need to efficiently find all starting indices in the string s where a substring matches a concatenation of all strings in the array words, in any order. Here's how we can do it:


---

Key Idea

1. Each substring of s that matches the criteria will:

Have a length equal to the total length of concatenated words: len(words) * len(words[0]).

Contain every word in words exactly once.



2. We use a sliding window approach:

Slide a window of size total_length over the string s.

For each window, check if it contains all the words in words using a frequency count.





---

Algorithm

Step 1: Pre-compute Word Frequencies

We calculate the frequency of each word in words:

word_count = Counter(words)

Step 2: Sliding Window

1. Iterate through the string s using a sliding window.


2. For each potential starting index i, extract a substring of length total_length.


3. Divide the substring into chunks of size word_length and check:

If all chunks match the word frequencies in word_count.



4. If valid, add the starting index i to the result.



Step 3: Optimization

Instead of sliding one character at a time, iterate through the string with an offset equal to the word length. This ensures we efficiently handle overlapping words.

Code Implementation

Here’s the Python implementation:

from collections import Counter

def findSubstring(s, words):
    if not s or not words:
        return []
    
    # Length of each word and total concatenated substring
    word_length = len(words[0])
    total_length = word_length * len(words)
    
    # Count of all words
    word_count = Counter(words)
    
    # Result list
    result = []
    
    # Iterate with offset
    for i in range(word_length):
        left = i
        right = i
        current_count = Counter()
        
        while right + word_length <= len(s):
            # Extract the current word from the substring
            word = s[right:right + word_length]
            right += word_length
            
            # If the word is part of `words`
            if word in word_count:
                current_count[word] += 1
                
                # If a word occurs too many times, move `left` to shrink the window
                while current_count[word] > word_count[word]:
                    current_count[s[left:left + word_length]] -= 1
                    left += word_length
                
                # Check if the window size matches `total_length`
                if right - left == total_length:
                    result.append(left)
            
            # If the word is not part of `words`, reset the window
            else:
                current_count.clear()
                left = right
    
    return result

Explanation of the Code

1. Preprocessing:

word_count holds the frequency of each word in words.



2. Sliding Window with Offset:

We process the string s in chunks of word_length, starting at every possible offset (0 to word_length - 1).

This helps efficiently handle overlapping cases.



3. Validating a Window:

As we slide the window, we use current_count to track the frequency of words within the current window.

If any word exceeds its frequency in word_count, we shrink the window from the left.



4. Adding Valid Indices:

If the window length matches total_length and all word frequencies are valid, add the starting index to the result.

Example Walkthrough

Example 1:

s = "barfoothefoobarman"
words = ["foo", "bar"]

1. word_length = 3, total_length = 6.


2. word_count = {"foo": 1, "bar": 1}.


3. Sliding window:

Starting at index 0:

Substring: "barfoo", valid, add 0.


Starting at index 9:

Substring: "foobar", valid, add 9.





Output:

[0, 9]

Example 2:

s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword"
words = ["word", "good", "best", "word"]

1. word_length = 4, total_length = 16.


2. word_count = {"word": 2, "good": 1, "best": 1}.


3. Sliding window:

No valid substring matches word_count.




Output:

[]

Edge Cases

1. Empty Input: If s or words is empty, return [].


2. All Words Match Once: Handle cases where words contains no duplicates.


3. Overlapping Words: Efficiently handle overlapping words using the offset.

Final Notes

This solution efficiently handles the problem constraints, ensuring we avoid generating all permutations or substrings, which would be computationally expensive.

The offset part in this function is crucial for handling overlapping and non-aligned substrings effectively. Let’s break it down:

Why the Offset?

The function processes the string s in chunks of size equal to the length of each word in words. However, since the valid substrings may not always start at the beginning of the string (index 0), the function iterates with different offsets to ensure all possible starting points are considered.


---

How the Offset Works

The offset is controlled by this loop:

for i in range(word_length):
    left = i
    right = i

word_length: The length of each word in words.

i (offset): The starting point of the sliding window. It takes values from 0 to word_length - 1.


By iterating through offsets, the function ensures it processes every possible substring alignment.


---

Example Walkthrough

Suppose:

s = "barfoothefoobarman"

words = ["foo", "bar"]

word_length = 3 (since each word has length 3)

total_length = 6 (total length of concatenated words)


Offset i = 0

Start processing substrings aligned at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6...).

For example:

Substring "bar" at index 0.

Substring "foo" at index 3.



Offset i = 1

Start processing substrings aligned at indices shifted by 1 (1, 4, 7...).

For example:

Substring "arf" at index 1 (not in words).

Substring "oot" at index 4 (not in words).



Offset i = 2

Start processing substrings aligned at indices shifted by 2 (2, 5, 8...).

For example:

Substring "rfo" at index 2 (not in words).

Substring "oth" at index 5 (not in words).




---

Key Insight

By iterating over offsets from 0 to word_length - 1, the function handles all possible alignments of substrings within s. This ensures no potential starting position of the valid concatenated substring is missed.


---

Sliding Window Logic with Offset

For each offset:

1. Initialize left and right pointers at i.


2. Slide the right pointer in steps of word_length to extract words.


3. Use left to shrink the window when:

A word occurs too many times.

A word is not part of the dictionary.





---

Efficiency

This approach avoids processing redundant substrings and ensures the function works efficiently, even for large inputs. Without this offset logic, the function might miss valid substrings or repeatedly process the same substrings.

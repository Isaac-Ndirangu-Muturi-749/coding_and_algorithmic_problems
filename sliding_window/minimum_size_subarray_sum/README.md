To solve the problem of finding the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to the target, we can use the **sliding window** (or two-pointer) technique. This approach allows us to efficiently determine the minimal length by adjusting the start and end of the window based on the sum of elements within the current window.

### Approach:

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We maintain a window using two pointers: `start` and `end`.
   - The `end` pointer expands the window by moving to the right and adding elements to the current sum.
   - Once the current sum is greater than or equal to the target, we attempt to shrink the window from the left by moving the `start` pointer to the right, subtracting elements from the current sum. This helps in finding the minimal length subarray.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If no subarray meets the target sum, return 0.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `target = 7`, `nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`
- **Process**:
  - Initialize `start = 0`, `current_sum = 0`, and `min_length = infinity`.
  - Expand the window by moving `end` from 0 to 5:
    - Add `nums[end]` to `current_sum`.
    - If `current_sum` >= `target`, update `min_length` and shrink the window by moving `start`.
  - The minimal length subarray that meets the condition is `[4,3]` with length `2`.
- **Output**: `2`

### Implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: [int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_length = float('inf')  # Set to infinity initially
        current_sum = 0
        start = 0

        for end in range(n):
            current_sum += nums[end]

            while current_sum >= target:
                min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)
                current_sum -= nums[start]
                start += 1

        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

### Explanation:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The `end` pointer moves across the array once, and the `start` pointer only moves forward, resulting in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables and no additional data structures proportional to the input size.

### Testing:

```python
solution = Solution()

# Test case 1
assert solution.minSubArrayLen(7, [2,3,1,2,4,3]) == 2

# Test case 2
assert solution.minSubArrayLen(4, [1,4,4]) == 1

# Test case 3
assert solution.minSubArrayLen(11, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]) == 0

print("All test cases passed!")
```

### Conclusion:
The sliding window technique is effective for this problem as it efficiently finds the minimal length subarray that meets the condition without requiring a nested loop. The implementation is optimal and handles edge cases like subarrays that do not exist or have a minimal length of 1.


Sure! Let's break down the `minSubArrayLen` function step by step:

### Problem Context:
- **Objective**: To find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to a given target number. If there isnâ€™t one, return 0 instead.
- **Input**:
  - `target`: an integer representing the sum you want to achieve or exceed.
  - `nums`: a list of integers.

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
    ```python
    n = len(nums)
    min_length = float('inf')  # Set to infinity initially
    current_sum = 0
    start = 0
    ```
   - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
   - `min_length` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`). This will hold the minimum length of the subarray found.
   - `current_sum` tracks the sum of the current subarray.
   - `start` is the index of the start of the current subarray.

2. **Main Loop (Sliding Window Technique)**:
    ```python
    for end in range(n):
        current_sum += nums[end]
    ```
   - We loop through the array using `end` as the current index. At each step, the value at `nums[end]` is added to `current_sum`.
   - This loop is effectively expanding the window (or subarray) by including the element at `end`.

3. **Inner While Loop (Shrinking the Window)**:
    ```python
    while current_sum >= target:
        min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1)
        current_sum -= nums[start]
        start += 1
    ```
   - This loop checks if the current sum (`current_sum`) is greater than or equal to `target`.
   - If it is, we attempt to minimize the length of the subarray:
     - The `min_length` is updated to the smaller of its current value or the length of the current subarray (`end - start + 1`).
     - We then subtract `nums[start]` from `current_sum` and move `start` to the right (`start += 1`) to shrink the window, making the subarray smaller.
   - The while loop continues until `current_sum` becomes less than `target`, at which point the outer for loop continues to expand the window by moving `end` to the right.

4. **Result**:
    ```python
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
    ```
   - After the loop, if `min_length` is still infinity, it means no valid subarray was found, so the function returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the smallest length of a subarray that meets or exceeds the target sum.

### Example:
- Suppose `target = 7` and `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`.
- The function will find that the minimal subarray with a sum of at least 7 is `[4, 3]` (or `[2, 4, 3]`), with a length of 2.
- Hence, the function would return 2.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` list. The algorithm processes each element at most twice, once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're only using a few variables for storage and not any additional data structures.

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique. The key is to maintain a window that contains at most one 0 (since we can delete one element). The length of this window will determine the size of the longest subarray of 1s after deleting one element.


---

Approach:

1. Use two pointers, left and right, to represent the current sliding window.


2. Traverse the array with the right pointer:

If the current element is 0, increment a counter (zero_count) to track the number of 0s in the window.

If zero_count > 1, move the left pointer to shrink the window until zero_count <= 1.



3. At each step, calculate the length of the window (right - left) and update the maximum length found so far.


4. Return the maximum length, adjusted for the required deletion (i.e., subtract one element).

Implementation:

def longestSubarray(nums):
    left = 0
    zero_count = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # Increment zero_count if we encounter a 0
        if nums[right] == 0:
            zero_count += 1
        
        # If there are more than one 0, shrink the window
        while zero_count > 1:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                zero_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        # Update the maximum length (subtract 1 because we must delete one element)
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left)
    
    return max_length

Explanation of the Code:

1. Sliding Window:

The window expands as right moves through the array.

When the window contains more than one 0, it is invalid, so the left pointer moves to shrink the window.



2. Window Length:

The length of the valid window is calculated as right - left.



3. Adjust for Deletion:

Since we must delete one element, we track the valid window size directly.

Complexity Analysis:

1. Time Complexity: 

The right pointer traverses the array once, and the left pointer only moves forward, making it linear.



2. Space Complexity: 

Only a few variables are used for tracking.

Example Walkthrough:

Example 1:

nums = [1, 1, 0, 1]

left = 0, zero_count = 0, max_length = 0

Iteration:

right = 0: nums[right] = 1, zero_count = 0, max_length = 1

right = 1: nums[right] = 1, zero_count = 0, max_length = 2

right = 2: nums[right] = 0, zero_count = 1, max_length = 2

right = 3: nums[right] = 1, zero_count = 1, max_length = 3


Output: 3


Example 2:

nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

left = 0, zero_count = 0, max_length = 0

Iteration:

right = 0: nums[right] = 0, zero_count = 1, max_length = 0

right = 1: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 1

right = 2: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 2

right = 3: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 3

right = 4: nums[right] = 0, zero_count = 2, shrink window to left = 1, zero_count = 1

Continue sliding window...

Final max_length = 5


Output: 5


Example 3:

nums = [1, 1, 1]

left = 0, zero_count = 0, max_length = 0

Iteration:

right = 0: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 1

right = 1: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 2

right = 2: nums[right] = 1, max_length = 3


Adjust for deletion: max_length = 2

Output: 2

This approach ensures efficient calculation of the longest subarray while adhering to the constraints.

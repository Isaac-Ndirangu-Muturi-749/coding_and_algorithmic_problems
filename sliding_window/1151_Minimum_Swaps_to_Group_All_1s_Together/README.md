## Problem Description
Given a binary array `data`, which consists only of 0s and 1s, the task is to find the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1s` together in the array. The `1s` can be placed at any location within the array, but they must be consecutive (i.e., no `0s` in between them). By swap, we mean taking two adjacent elements and exchanging their positions. This problem is asking us to perform a series of swaps to bring all `1s` together and minimize the number of swaps made in this process.

To provide more clarity, a swap can only be made with two adjacent elements, which means you cannot take a `1` and swap it with another `1` if there is a `0` in between without first swapping that `0` out of the way. The goal is to find the optimal strategy so that you minimize the total number of swaps required.

## Intuition
The intuition behind the solution involves **sliding window** and **greedy strategies**.

Firstly, we must realize that we are grouping all `1s` together. Instead of focusing on the `0s` we need to move, we concentrate on the segment containing the maximum number of `1s`. Why? Because the fewer the `0s` in this segment, the fewer swaps are needed for grouping `1s` together. The size of this segment (i.e., the window) will be equal to the total number of `1s` in the array; let's call it `k`. So, the window will be a subarray of length `k`.

The number of swaps required will then be the number of `0s` in our optimal segment because each of these `0s` will need to be swapped with a `1` outside the segment.

To find the optimal segment, we consider all possible segments of length `k` by using a **sliding window** through the array. For each segment, we calculate how many `1s` it contains — this tells us indirectly the number of `0s` since the window's length is fixed. We want the segment with the maximum number of `1s` because that would mean the minimum number of `0s`, and thus the minimum number of swaps needed.

The code sets up this sliding window starting from the beginning of the array and initializes a variable `mx` with the number of `1s` in this first window. It then moves the window across the array one element at a time, calculating the count of `1s` by adding `data[i]` and subtracting `data[i - k]`, which keeps the window size constant. If the count is greater than `mx`, it updates `mx`. Finally, because `k` is the total number of `1s` that should be grouped together, the minimum number of swaps needed is equal to the number of `0s` in the optimal segment, which is `k - mx`.

## Solution Approach
The solution leverages the **[sliding window](/problems/sliding_window_maximum)** technique to efficiently compute the number of `1s` in each window of size `k`, where `k` is the total number of `1s` in the input array `data`.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Counting `1s` in the Array**: We start by counting the number of `1s` in the entire array using `data.count(1)`, which will determine the size of our sliding window. This count is stored in the variable `k`.
2. **Initial Window Setup**: We set up the initial window by calculating the sum of the first `k` elements in the array (`sum(data[:k])`). The result gives us the number of `1s` in the initial window, which is stored in the variable `t`. We also introduce a variable `mx` to keep track of the maximum number of `1s` found in any window, which is initially equal to `t`.
3. **Sliding Window Movement**: We then iterate through the array starting from the `k`th element. In each iteration, we simulate the sliding of the window by one element to the right. We add the new element that enters the window (`data[i]`) to `t` and subtract the element that leaves the window (`data[i - k]`) from `t`.
4. **Updating the Maximum `1s` Count**: After adjusting `t` for the new window position, we check if the updated count is greater than the current maximum (`mx`). If it is, we update `mx` to this new value.
5. **Calculating the Result**: Once we have completed sliding through the array, we subtract the maximum `1s` count (`mx`) from the total number of `1s` (`k`). The result (`k - mx`) represents the minimum number of swaps required to group all `1s` because it's the number of `0s` in the window that contains the maximum number of `1s`.

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because each element in `data` is visited at most twice—once when it enters the window and once when it leaves.

## Solution Implementation

### Python Code:
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def min_swaps(self, data: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate the total number of 1s needed to form a continuous subarray.
        total_ones = data.count(1)

        # Initialize the current count of 1s in the first window of size 'total_ones'.
        current_count = sum(data[:total_ones])

        # Initialize the maximum count of 1s found so far to the current count of the initial window.
        max_ones = current_count

        # Iterate over the array starting from the end of the first window to the end of the array.
        for i in range(total_ones, len(data)):
            # Include the next element in the window and remove the trailing element to slide the window forward.
            current_count += data[i]
            current_count -= data[i - total_ones]

            # Update the maximum count of 1s if the current window has more 1s than any previous ones.
            max_ones = max(max_ones, current_count)

        # The minimum number of swaps equals the number of 0s in the largest window of 1s (size of the window - max count of 1s).
        return total_ones - max_ones

```

## Time and Space Complexity
### **Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the `min_swaps` function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `data` array. The function comprises two main operations:
1. Counting the number of `1s` in the `data` array using `data.count(1)`. This operation goes through each element of the array, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)**.
2. The sliding window loop, which starts from index `k` up to the end of the array. In each iteration, the function adds the current element and subtracts the element `k` positions before it. The loop runs `n - k` times. Since addition and subtraction are constant-time operations, the time complexity of the loop is **O(n - k)**. Since `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop still implies an **O(n)** time complexity.

Combining both parts, the overall time complexity is **O(n) + O(n) = O(n)**.

### **Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this function is **O(1)**. It uses a fixed number of variables (`k`, `t`, and `mx`) that do not depend on the size of the input. No additional data structures that scale with the size of the input are used, making it an efficient approach.

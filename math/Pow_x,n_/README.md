To solve the problem of calculating `pow(x, n)`, which computes `x` raised to the power `n`, we can take advantage of **exponentiation by squaring**, a well-known algorithm to compute powers efficiently in O(log n) time. This approach allows us to reduce the problem size by halving the exponent at each step.

### Approach:

1. **Exponentiation by squaring**:
   - If `n` is even, \( x^n = (x^{n/2})^2 \).
   - If `n` is odd, \( x^n = x \times x^{n-1} \).

2. **Handling negative exponents**:
   - If `n` is negative, we calculate the reciprocal of the positive exponent: \( x^n = \frac{1}{x^{-n}} \).

3. **Base cases**:
   - When \( n = 0 \), \( x^0 = 1 \) (as long as \( x \neq 0 \)).
   - When \( n = 1 \), \( x^n = x \).

### Algorithm:

1. First, handle the negative exponent case by converting `n` to a positive value and working with the reciprocal of `x`.
2. Use a loop to iteratively square `x` and halve `n` until `n` becomes zero.
3. Multiply the result appropriately when `n` is odd.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        # Handle the case of negative exponent
        if n < 0:
            x = 1 / x
            n = -n

        result = 1
        current_product = x

        while n > 0:
            # If n is odd, multiply the current product to the result
            if n % 2 == 1:
                result *= current_product

            # Square the current product and halve n
            current_product *= current_product
            n //= 2

        return result
```

### Explanation:

- **Negative exponent handling**: When `n` is negative, we flip `x` to `1/x` and convert `n` to a positive value, so we can use the same logic for both positive and negative exponents.
- **Exponentiation by squaring**:
  - If `n` is odd, we multiply the result by the current `x`.
  - At each step, we square `x` and halve `n` to reduce the problem size.
- **Loop**: The loop continues until `n` becomes zero, at which point the `result` contains the final value.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time complexity**: O(log n) — We halve `n` at each step, leading to logarithmic time complexity.
- **Space complexity**: O(1) — Only a few variables are used, so the space complexity is constant.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `x = 2.00000, n = 10`
- We start with `result = 1` and `current_product = 2.00000`.
- Steps:
  1. Since `n = 10` (even), we square `current_product = 4.0` and halve `n = 5`.
  2. Since `n = 5` (odd), we multiply `result = 4.0` and square `current_product = 16.0`, then halve `n = 2`.
  3. Since `n = 2` (even), we square `current_product = 256.0` and halve `n = 1`.
  4. Since `n = 1` (odd), we multiply `result = 1024.0`.
- **Output**: `1024.00000`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `x = 2.10000, n = 3`
- We start with `result = 1` and `current_product = 2.10000`.
- Steps:
  1. Since `n = 3` (odd), we multiply `result = 2.1` and square `current_product = 4.41`, then halve `n = 1`.
  2. Since `n = 1` (odd), we multiply `result = 9.261`.
- **Output**: `9.26100`

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `x = 2.00000, n = -2`
- We convert `x` to `1/2 = 0.5` and set `n = 2`.
- Steps:
  1. Since `n = 2` (even), we square `current_product = 0.25` and halve `n = 1`.
  2. Since `n = 1` (odd), we multiply `result = 0.25`.
- **Output**: `0.25000`

### Summary:
This approach efficiently calculates `x^n` in O(log n) time by reducing the exponent size at each step. It handles both positive and negative exponents and ensures optimal time complexity through exponentiation by squaring.


This part of the code is crucial for handling **odd exponents** in the **exponentiation by squaring** method. Let's break it down:

### The Goal:
Exponentiation by squaring works by breaking down the exponent `n` into smaller pieces, so we can compute powers more efficiently than just multiplying `x` repeatedly.

When `n` is **odd**, we cannot fully reduce the problem by just squaring the base and halving the exponent. We need to account for that extra factor of `x`. For instance, if you have \( x^5 \), you can break it down as:

\[
x^5 = x \times x^4 = x \times (x^2)^2
\]

In this case, after squaring `x` to get \( x^2 \), and further squaring to get \( (x^2)^2 \), you are left with one extra \( x \) to multiply. This happens when the exponent is odd.

### The Logic in the Code:

```python
# If n is odd, multiply the current product to the result
if n % 2 == 1:
    result *= current_product
```

- **Check if `n` is odd**:
   - `n % 2 == 1` checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, there will be an extra multiplication step needed.

- **Why multiply by `current_product`?**:
   - `current_product` represents the base \( x \) (or a squared version of \( x \)) at the current stage of the algorithm.
   - When `n` is odd, we multiply `result` by `current_product` because, in the process of halving `n` (to make the exponent smaller), we lose one factor of \( x \), so we need to multiply it back.

- **Example**:
   - Let's say we want to compute \( x^5 \). Using exponentiation by squaring, we can write:

\[
x^5 = x \times (x^2)^2
\]

   - So, the loop first squares `x` to get \( x^2 \), then squares again to get \( (x^2)^2 \), but since 5 is odd, we need to multiply the result by \( x \) (which is the base value before squaring).

### Step-by-Step Example:

Let's walk through an example where \( x = 2 \) and \( n = 5 \):

1. **Initial values**: `result = 1`, `current_product = 2`, `n = 5`.

2. **First iteration** (`n = 5` is odd):
   - Multiply `result *= current_product` → `result = 1 * 2 = 2`.
   - Square `current_product = current_product * current_product` → `current_product = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 5 // 2 = 2`.

3. **Second iteration** (`n = 2` is even):
   - Don't multiply the result since `n` is even.
   - Square `current_product = current_product * current_product` → `current_product = 4 * 4 = 16`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 2 // 2 = 1`.

4. **Third iteration** (`n = 1` is odd):
   - Multiply `result *= current_product` → `result = 2 * 16 = 32`.
   - Square `current_product = current_product * current_product` → `current_product = 16 * 16 = 256`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 1 // 2 = 0`.

5. **Final result**: `result = 32`, which is \( 2^5 \).

### Summary:
When `n` is odd, we can't fully break down the exponent by squaring alone because there's always one extra multiplication needed. This line `result *= current_product` ensures we handle this extra factor of \( x \) when `n` is odd.


Yes, we can solve this problem in a way that **`x` doesn't change** by keeping the value of `x` intact while we work with an auxiliary variable to represent the changing powers. We do this by introducing a **temporary product** to accumulate the result, and we never modify the base `x` itself.

Here’s the strategy to achieve this:

1. Use an auxiliary variable (like `current_product` or `power`) to represent the growing powers of `x` as we compute.
2. The original base `x` remains untouched throughout the algorithm.
3. The algorithm itself still uses **exponentiation by squaring** for efficiency (i.e., reducing the exponent `n` by half repeatedly).

Here’s how you can do it:

### Code:

```python
def myPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    # Handle the case where n is negative
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n

    result = 1  # This will hold the final answer
    current_product = x  # This holds x^1, x^2, x^4, x^8, etc.

    while n > 0:
        # If n is odd, multiply the result by the current product
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= current_product
        # Square the current product for the next step
        current_product *= current_product
        # Halve the exponent n
        n //= 2

    return result
```

### Key Changes:

- **The original `x` never changes**: We keep `x` intact throughout the algorithm.
- **`current_product` accumulates the powers**: Instead of modifying `x`, we square `current_product` to grow the power progressively, starting from \( x^1 \), \( x^2 \), \( x^4 \), and so on.
- **`result` accumulates the final value**: This variable is initialized to 1, and only when necessary (i.e., when `n` is odd), we multiply it by `current_product` to incorporate that odd power of `x`.

### Step-by-Step Example:

Let’s walk through an example with \( x = 2.0 \) and \( n = 10 \):

1. **Initial values**:
   - `x = 2.0`, `n = 10`, `result = 1`, `current_product = 2.0`.

2. **First iteration** (`n = 10` is even):
   - Square `current_product` → `current_product = 2.0 * 2.0 = 4.0`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 10 // 2 = 5`.

3. **Second iteration** (`n = 5` is odd):
   - Multiply `result *= current_product` → `result = 1 * 4.0 = 4.0`.
   - Square `current_product` → `current_product = 4.0 * 4.0 = 16.0`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 5 // 2 = 2`.

4. **Third iteration** (`n = 2` is even):
   - Square `current_product` → `current_product = 16.0 * 16.0 = 256.0`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 2 // 2 = 1`.

5. **Fourth iteration** (`n = 1` is odd):
   - Multiply `result *= current_product` → `result = 4.0 * 256.0 = 1024.0`.
   - Square `current_product` → `current_product = 256.0 * 256.0 = 65536.0`.
   - Halve `n //= 2` → `n = 1 // 2 = 0`.

6. **Final result**: `result = 1024.0`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time complexity**: O(log n). At each step, the exponent `n` is halved, making the algorithm logarithmic in `n`.
- **Space complexity**: O(1). We use only a few variables (`result`, `current_product`), and no extra space is needed for recursion or additional data structures.

### Summary:
In this approach, we never change the value of `x`. We use `current_product` to keep track of powers of `x` and `result` to accumulate the final answer. This approach still maintains efficiency by using exponentiation by squaring while ensuring that `x` stays constant.

To count the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number `n!`, we need to understand how trailing zeroes are formed.

### Key Observation:
A trailing zero is produced by multiplying 10. The number 10 can be factored into `2 * 5`. In the factorial `n!`, there are usually more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of trailing zeroes is determined by how many factors of 5 are present in `n!`.

### Steps:
1. Count how many multiples of 5 are there in the numbers from `1` to `n`. Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5.
2. Numbers like 25, 125, etc., contribute more than one factor of 5 (e.g., 25 = 5^2, so it contributes two factors of 5). Therefore, we also need to account for these higher powers of 5.
3. To find the total number of factors of 5, we repeatedly divide `n` by 5 and sum the quotients.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
2. While `n` is greater than or equal to 5:
   - Divide `n` by 5 and add the result to `count`.
   - Repeat the process with `n = n // 5`.

### Solution:

```python
def trailingZeroes(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    while n >= 5:
        n //= 5
        count += n
    return count
```

### Explanation:
- Each time we divide `n` by 5, we count how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., exist in `n!`.
- This ensures that we correctly count all factors of 5, including those contributed by higher powers of 5.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `n = 3`
- 3! = 6, so there are no trailing zeroes.
- Output: `0`

#### Example 2:
Input: `n = 5`
- 5! = 120, which has one trailing zero.
- The number of multiples of 5 between 1 and 5 is 1, so we have 1 trailing zero.
- Output: `1`

#### Example 3:
Input: `n = 10`
- 10! = 3,628,800, which has two trailing zeroes.
- The number of multiples of 5 between 1 and 10 is 2 (5 and 10), so we have 2 trailing zeroes.
- Output: `2`

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(log n)` because we divide `n` by 5 repeatedly. This is a logarithmic operation.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently solves the problem with logarithmic time complexity, as required.



Let's break down how the function `trailingZeroes(n: int)` works when we pass in `n = 100` as an example. The goal of this function is to calculate how many trailing zeroes are in the factorial of `100!`.

### Explanation:
Trailing zeroes in a factorial result from multiplying factors of `10`, which is the product of `2` and `5`. Since there are always more factors of `2` than `5` in the prime factorization of factorials, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by how many times `5` appears as a factor in the numbers from `1` to `n`.

To calculate the number of trailing zeroes, we count how many multiples of `5` are in the numbers `1` to `n`, how many multiples of `25` (because each multiple of `25` contains two factors of `5`), and so on.

The function repeatedly divides `n` by `5` and adds the result to the count until `n` becomes less than `5`.

### Steps for `n = 100`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `n = 100`.
   - Initialize `count = 0`.

2. **First Division** (`n //= 5`):
   - Divide `100` by `5`: `100 // 5 = 20`.
   - Add this value to `count`: `count = 0 + 20 = 20`.

   This tells us there are `20` multiples of `5` in the numbers from `1` to `100`.

3. **Second Division** (`n //= 5`):
   - Now, divide `20` by `5`: `20 // 5 = 4`.
   - Add this value to `count`: `count = 20 + 4 = 24`.

   This tells us there are `4` multiples of `25` in the numbers from `1` to `100`. Since `25` has an extra factor of `5`, we need to account for it.

4. **Third Division** (`n //= 5`):
   - Now, divide `4` by `5`: `4 // 5 = 0`.
   - Add this value to `count`: `count = 24 + 0 = 24`.

   Since `n < 5`, we stop here.

### Final Count:
The total number of trailing zeroes in `100!` is `24`. This is because there are `20` multiples of `5`, and an additional `4` multiples of `25`, contributing extra factors of `5`.

### Conclusion:
The function calculates that `100!` (the factorial of 100) has **24 trailing zeroes**.



The factorial of 100 (100!) is:

93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000

It's a very large number, which explains why factorial values grow so rapidly!

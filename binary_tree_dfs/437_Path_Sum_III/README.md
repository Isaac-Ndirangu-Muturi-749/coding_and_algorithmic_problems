To solve this problem, we can use a combination of **DFS (Depth-First Search)** and a **hash map** to efficiently count the number of paths that sum up to `targetSum`.

---

### Approach:
1. **Prefix Sum**:
   - The prefix sum is the sum of all node values from the root to the current node. We use it to keep track of sums along a path.
   - At each node, the number of paths that sum to `targetSum` can be determined using the equation:
     \[
     \text{current sum} - \text{targetSum} = \text{prefix sum seen previously}
     \]

2. **Hash Map**:
   - Use a hash map to store the count of prefix sums encountered so far. This helps in quickly checking how many paths have a sum equal to `targetSum`.

3. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Traverse the tree in a depth-first manner, updating the prefix sum at each node.
   - Check for paths ending at the current node that satisfy the condition:
     \[
     \text{current prefix sum} - \text{targetSum} \in \text{hash map}
     \]
   - Backtrack after exploring a node to ensure the hash map remains valid for sibling nodes.

---

### Implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pathSum(root, targetSum):
    def dfs(node, curr_sum):
        if not node:
            return 0

        # Update the current prefix sum
        curr_sum += node.val

        # Count paths that end at the current node and sum to targetSum
        count = prefix_sums.get(curr_sum - targetSum, 0)

        # Update the prefix_sums dictionary
        prefix_sums[curr_sum] = prefix_sums.get(curr_sum, 0) + 1

        # Recurse to left and right children
        count += dfs(node.left, curr_sum)
        count += dfs(node.right, curr_sum)

        # Backtrack: remove the current prefix sum from the map
        prefix_sums[curr_sum] -= 1

        return count

    # Dictionary to store the prefix sums
    prefix_sums = {0: 1}

    return dfs(root, 0)
```

---

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `None`, return 0 as there are no paths.

2. **Count Paths**:
   - Use `curr_sum - targetSum` to check how many valid prefix sums exist in the hash map. Add their count to the total.

3. **Update Hash Map**:
   - Add the current prefix sum to the hash map before exploring child nodes.
   - After finishing with the current node, backtrack by decrementing the count of the current prefix sum to maintain correctness.

4. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Recurse for both left and right subtrees, passing the updated `curr_sum`.

---

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each node is visited once, and for each node, hash map operations (insert, get, and delete) are \(O(1)\).
   - Total: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The hash map stores at most \(O(h)\) entries, where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
   - In the worst case, \(h = O(n)\) for a skewed tree. For a balanced tree, \(h = O(\log n)\).

---

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:
```python
root = TreeNode(10)
root.left = TreeNode(5)
root.right = TreeNode(-3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
root.right.right = TreeNode(11)
root.left.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left.right = TreeNode(-2)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(1)

targetSum = 8
```

#### Execution:
- Paths that sum to 8:
  1. \(10 \to -3 \to 11\)
  2. \(5 \to 3\)
  3. \(3 \to 5\)
- Output: `3`

---

This approach efficiently counts the paths and works well for large trees.


Let's break down the code using an example and explain the logic behind it.

---

### **Problem Summary**
The function `pathSum` finds the number of paths in a binary tree where the sum of the nodes equals `targetSum`. The paths do **not need to start at the root or end at a leaf**, but they must consist of consecutive nodes.

---

### **Example Tree**
```plaintext
        10
       /  \
      5   -3
     / \     \
    3   2     11
   / \   \
  3  -2   1
```

#### **Target Sum = 8**

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Prefix Sum:**
   - A prefix sum is the sum of all node values from the root to the current node.
   - It helps us determine if there exists a sub-path with the desired sum by calculating:
     ```plaintext
     curr_sum - targetSum
     ```
   - If this value exists in the `prefix_sums` dictionary, it means there is a sub-path (ending at the current node) whose sum equals `targetSum`.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - As we traverse the tree, we add the `curr_sum` to `prefix_sums`.
   - After exploring all paths through the current node, we backtrack by removing the current node's `curr_sum` from `prefix_sums`. This ensures the dictionary only tracks sums for the current path.

---

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **Initialization**
- Start at the root node (`10`).
- Initialize `prefix_sums = {0: 1}` (this handles paths starting at the root).

---

#### **Traversal**

1. **At Node `10`:**
   - `curr_sum = 10` (prefix sum so far).
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 10 - 8 = 2`. Does `2` exist in `prefix_sums`? **No**.
   - Add `10` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1}`.
   - Recur to left child (`5`).

---

2. **At Node `5`:**
   - `curr_sum = 10 + 5 = 15`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 15 - 8 = 7`. Does `7` exist in `prefix_sums`? **No**.
   - Add `15` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1}`.
   - Recur to left child (`3`).

---

3. **At Node `3`:**
   - `curr_sum = 15 + 3 = 18`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 18 - 8 = 10`. Does `10` exist in `prefix_sums`? **Yes**, count = 1.
   - Add `18` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 18: 1}`.
   - Recur to left child (`3`).

---

4. **At Node `3`:**
   - `curr_sum = 18 + 3 = 21`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 21 - 8 = 13`. Does `13` exist in `prefix_sums`? **No**.
   - Add `21` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 18: 1, 21: 1}`.
   - Recur to left and right children (both `None`).

   **Backtrack:**
   - Remove `21` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 18: 1}`.

---

5. **At Node `-2`:**
   - `curr_sum = 18 - 2 = 16`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 16 - 8 = 8`. Does `8` exist in `prefix_sums`? **No**.
   - Add `16` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 18: 1, 16: 1}`.
   - Recur to left and right children (both `None`).

   **Backtrack:**
   - Remove `16` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 18: 1}`.

---

6. **Backtrack to Node `5`:**
   - Remove `18` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1}`.

---

7. **At Node `2`:**
   - `curr_sum = 15 + 2 = 17`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 17 - 8 = 9`. Does `9` exist in `prefix_sums`? **No**.
   - Add `17` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 17: 1}`.
   - Recur to right child (`1`).

---

8. **At Node `1`:**
   - `curr_sum = 17 + 1 = 18`.
   - Check `curr_sum - targetSum = 18 - 8 = 10`. Does `10` exist in `prefix_sums`? **Yes**, count = 1.
   - Add `18` to `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 17: 1, 18: 1}`.

   **Backtrack:**
   - Remove `18` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1, 17: 1}`.

---

9. **Backtrack to Node `2`:**
   - Remove `17` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1, 15: 1}`.

---

10. **Backtrack to Node `10`:**
    - Remove `15` from `prefix_sums`: `{0: 1, 10: 1}`.

---

### **Result**
After traversing the entire tree, the total count of paths that sum to `8` is **3**:
1. `5 → 3`
2. `10 → -3 → 11`
3. `5 → 2 → 1`

This is how the prefix sums efficiently track potential paths and avoid recalculating sums repeatedly.

Solution: Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree

The problem requires finding the maximum path sum in a binary tree, where a path is any sequence of nodes connected by edges, appearing at most once in the sequence.


---

Key Observations

1. A path can start and end at any nodeâ€”it doesnâ€™t need to include the root.


2. Each node can contribute to the maximum path sum in two ways:

As part of a larger path that continues upwards through its parent.

As a root of a subtree, forming a new maximum path that doesnâ€™t extend upwards.



3. The key challenge is to efficiently explore all paths and track the maximum sum encountered.




---

Approach

We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all paths while maintaining a global variable for the maximum sum.

1. Define a recursive helper function that:

Computes the maximum path sum that includes the current node and at most one of its children.

Updates the global maximum path sum if a split path (left + node + right) has a higher sum.



2. Base case: If a node is None, return 0 (no contribution).


3. Recursively compute the maximum path sum for left and right subtrees.


4. Ignore negative contributionsâ€”if a subtree has a negative sum, we treat it as 0.


5. Return the maximum path sum that can be extended upwards (either left or right child plus the node value).




---

Algorithm

1. Initialize a global variable max_sum = -inf to store the maximum path sum.


2. Define a recursive function max_gain(node):

If node is None, return 0.

Compute left_gain and right_gain using max(0, max_gain(node.left)) and max(0, max_gain(node.right)) (ignore negative sums).

Compute the path sum if the current node is treated as the highest node:
new_path_sum = node.val + left_gain + right_gain

Update max_sum if new_path_sum is greater.

Return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain) (extend the path).



3. Start DFS from the root node and return max_sum.

Implementation

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        # Step 1: Initialize global variable to track max sum
        self.max_sum = float('-inf')

        # Step 2: Define recursive function to compute max gain
        def max_gain(node):
            if not node:
                return 0  # Base case: null nodes contribute 0

            # Step 3: Compute max sum from left and right subtrees
            left_gain = max(0, max_gain(node.left))  # Ignore negative sums
            right_gain = max(0, max_gain(node.right))

            # Step 4: Compute path sum if node is treated as root
            new_path_sum = node.val + left_gain + right_gain

            # Step 5: Update global max sum if new path is greater
            self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, new_path_sum)

            # Step 6: Return max path sum extendable upwards
            return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)

        # Step 7: Start recursion from root
        max_gain(root)

        # Step 8: Return the maximum path sum found
        return self.max_sum

Explanation of Code

Recursive Function max_gain(node)

Computes the best path sum including node that can extend to its parent.

Uses max(0, ...) to ignore negative contributions.

Updates self.max_sum if the sum of the left, right, and node is the highest so far.


Tracking the Maximum Path Sum

self.max_sum ensures we track the best path found across all recursive calls.

Even if the path doesnâ€™t include the root, it will still be counted.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n) (Each node is visited once)

Space Complexity: O(h) (Recursive depth, h = height of the tree)

In a balanced tree, h = log(n), so O(log n)

In a skewed tree, h = n, so O(n) worst case

Example Walkthrough

Example 1

Input: root = [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6

Step-by-step:

max_gain(2) â†’ left_gain = 0, right_gain = 0 â†’ return 2
max_gain(3) â†’ left_gain = 0, right_gain = 0 â†’ return 3
max_gain(1) â†’ left_gain = 2, right_gain = 3
  new_path_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
  Update max_sum = 6


---

Example 2

Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

       -10
       /  \
      9   20
         /  \
        15   7

Output: 42

Step-by-step:

max_gain(9) â†’ return 9
max_gain(15) â†’ return 15
max_gain(7) â†’ return 7
max_gain(20) â†’ left_gain = 15, right_gain = 7
  new_path_sum = 20 + 15 + 7 = 42
  Update max_sum = 42
max_gain(-10) â†’ left_gain = 9, right_gain = 35
  new_path_sum = -10 + 9 + 35 = 34
  max_sum remains 42

Final output: 42.

Edge Cases

1. Single Node

Input: root = [5]
Output: 5


2. All Negative Values

Input: root = [-3, -2, -1]
Output: -1

We take the least negative node since adding more negative values reduces the sum.



3. Skewed Tree (Linked List)

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 15

The best path is the entire list.





---

Final Thoughts

DFS with a global variable ensures an efficient O(n) solution.

Handles negative values correctly using max(0, ...).

Handles all paths efficiently, including those not passing through the root.


âœ… Best approach for solving Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree! ðŸš€

The right gain is 35 because it is the maximum path sum obtained from the right subtree of node -10. Let's break it down step by step.


---

Given Binary Tree (Assumption)

We assume the tree looks something like this:

-10
      /    \
    9      20
         /    \
       15      7

Breakdown of max_gain(node)

Step 1: Compute max_gain(9)

9 is a leaf node, so:

max_gain(9) = 9


Step 2: Compute max_gain(15)

15 is a leaf node, so:

max_gain(15) = 15


Step 3: Compute max_gain(7)

7 is a leaf node, so:

max_gain(7) = 7


Step 4: Compute max_gain(20)

left_gain = max_gain(15) = 15

right_gain = max_gain(7) = 7

Compute new_path_sum:

new_path_sum = 20 + 15 + 7 = 42

Update max_sum = 42

Return the max single-path gain:

max_gain(20) = 20 + max(15, 7) = 20 + 15 = 35


Step 5: Compute max_gain(-10)

left_gain = max_gain(9) = 9

right_gain = max_gain(20) = 35

Compute new_path_sum:

new_path_sum = -10 + 9 + 35 = 34

Since 34 is less than max_sum (42), we do not update max_sum.

Return the max single-path gain:

max_gain(-10) = -10 + max(9, 35) = -10 + 35 = 25



---

Why is right gain 35?

When computing max_gain(-10), the right child of -10 is 20.

The maximum path sum from 20 (not including both children) is:

20 + max(15, 7) = 20 + 15 = 35

This is why right_gain = 35.


Would you like me to clarify anything further?

To solve the problem of finding the number of provinces, we can view the input matrix \( \text{isConnected} \) as an adjacency matrix of an undirected graph. The problem boils down to finding the number of connected components in the graph.

### Approach:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each city represents a node in the graph.
   - A value of `1` in \( \text{isConnected}[i][j] \) indicates there is an edge between city \(i\) and city \(j\).

2. **DFS or BFS Traversal**:
   - To find all connected components, we can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
   - Starting from any unvisited city, we traverse all its directly or indirectly connected nodes and mark them as visited.

3. **Count Components**:
   - Each time we start a new traversal from an unvisited city, it indicates a new province.

### Implementation Using DFS:

```python
def findCircleNum(isConnected):
    def dfs(node):
        for neighbor in range(n):
            if isConnected[node][neighbor] == 1 and not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                dfs(neighbor)

    n = len(isConnected)
    visited = [False] * n
    provinces = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            # Start a new DFS for a new province
            provinces += 1
            visited[i] = True
            dfs(i)

    return provinces
```

---

### Implementation Using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def findCircleNum(isConnected):
    n = len(isConnected)
    visited = [False] * n
    provinces = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            # Start a new BFS for a new province
            provinces += 1
            queue = deque([i])
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in range(n):
                    if isConnected[node][neighbor] == 1 and not visited[neighbor]:
                        visited[neighbor] = True
                        queue.append(neighbor)

    return provinces
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Input:
```python
isConnected = [[1,1,0],
               [1,1,0],
               [0,0,1]]
```

#### Execution:

1. **Using DFS**:
   - Start from city 0 (province 1):
     - Mark cities 0 and 1 as visited.
   - Start from city 2 (province 2):
     - Mark city 2 as visited.
   - Output: `2`

2. **Using BFS**:
   - Similar steps as DFS, marking connected cities during traversal.

---

### Complexity Analysis:

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Both DFS and BFS traverse the adjacency matrix.
   - For \(n\) cities, the adjacency matrix has \(n^2\) elements.
   - Time complexity: \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **DFS**: \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack.
   - **BFS**: \(O(n)\) for the queue.
   - Visited array also takes \(O(n)\) space.

### Example 2 Walkthrough:

#### Input:
```python
isConnected = [[1,0,0],
               [0,1,0],
               [0,0,1]]
```

#### Output:
- There are 3 isolated nodes (each is a province).
- Output: `3`.

This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints.


The `findCircleNum` function determines the number of connected components (or "provinces") in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix, `isConnected`. Each connected component represents a group of directly or indirectly connected nodes.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Adjacency Matrix**:
   - `isConnected[i][j] = 1` means there is a direct connection between node `i` and node `j`.
   - `isConnected[i][j] = 0` means there is no direct connection.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The function uses DFS to traverse all nodes in a connected component, marking them as visited to avoid redundant processing.

3. **Visited Array**:
   - `visited[i] = True` indicates that node `i` has already been explored and belongs to a province.

---

### **Example**

#### Input:
```python
isConnected = [
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
```

#### Explanation of the Matrix:
- There are 3 nodes (`n = 3`):
  - Node `0` is connected to node `1` (`isConnected[0][1] = 1` and `isConnected[1][0] = 1`).
  - Node `2` is not connected to any other nodes.

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution**

#### Initialization:
- `n = 3` (number of nodes).
- `visited = [False, False, False]` (none of the nodes have been visited yet).
- `provinces = 0` (no provinces identified yet).

#### Main Loop:
- **Iteration 1 (`i = 0`)**:
  - `visited[0] = False`, so this is a new province. Increment `provinces` to `1`.
  - Mark `visited[0] = True` and call `dfs(0)` to explore all nodes connected to `0`.

##### DFS Call for Node `0`:
- Check all neighbors of `0`:
  - Neighbor `0`: Already marked as visited (`isConnected[0][0] = 1`), so skip.
  - Neighbor `1`: `isConnected[0][1] = 1` and `visited[1] = False`. Mark `visited[1] = True` and call `dfs(1)`.

##### DFS Call for Node `1`:
- Check all neighbors of `1`:
  - Neighbor `0`: Already visited (`isConnected[1][0] = 1`), so skip.
  - Neighbor `1`: Already visited (`isConnected[1][1] = 1`), so skip.
  - Neighbor `2`: No connection (`isConnected[1][2] = 0`), so skip.
- Backtrack to the previous call.

- Backtrack to the main loop.

---

- **Iteration 2 (`i = 1`)**:
  - `visited[1] = True` (already explored in the first province), so skip.

---

- **Iteration 3 (`i = 2`)**:
  - `visited[2] = False`, so this is a new province. Increment `provinces` to `2`.
  - Mark `visited[2] = True` and call `dfs(2)`.

##### DFS Call for Node `2`:
- Check all neighbors of `2`:
  - Neighbor `0`: No connection (`isConnected[2][0] = 0`), so skip.
  - Neighbor `1`: No connection (`isConnected[2][1] = 0`), so skip.
  - Neighbor `2`: Already visited (`isConnected[2][2] = 1`), so skip.
- Backtrack to the main loop.

---

#### Final State:
- `visited = [True, True, True]` (all nodes have been visited).
- `provinces = 2`.

#### Output:
```python
return 2
```

---

### **How It Works for the Example**
1. The DFS starting at node `0` identifies the first province consisting of nodes `[0, 1]`.
2. The DFS starting at node `2` identifies the second province consisting of node `[2]`.

The result is `2 provinces`.

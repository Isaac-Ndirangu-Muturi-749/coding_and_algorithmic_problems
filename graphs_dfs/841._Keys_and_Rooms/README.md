To determine whether we can visit all the rooms, we can use either **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. The goal is to traverse the graph represented by the `rooms` list, starting from room `0` and collecting keys along the way.

---

### **Python Implementation**

Here is a solution using DFS:

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(rooms)
        visited = set()

        def dfs(room):
            if room in visited:
                return
            visited.add(room)
            for key in rooms[room]:
                dfs(key)

        # Start DFS from room 0
        dfs(0)
        return len(visited) == n
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Start from room `0` and mark it as visited.
   - For each key in the current room, recursively visit the rooms it unlocks if not already visited.

2. **Visited Set**:
   - Use a set to keep track of visited rooms and avoid visiting a room multiple times.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the traversal, check if the size of the `visited` set equals `n` (total number of rooms). If yes, all rooms are accessible.

---

### **Alternative Solution: BFS**

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        n = len(rooms)
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([0])  # Start from room 0

        while queue:
            room = queue.popleft()
            if room not in visited:
                visited.add(room)
                for key in rooms[room]:
                    if key not in visited:
                        queue.append(key)

        return len(visited) == n
```

---

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + k)\), where:
  - \(n\) is the number of rooms.
  - \(k\) is the total number of keys across all rooms.
  - Each room and key is processed once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the `visited` set and recursive call stack (in DFS) or the queue (in BFS).

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:
Input:
```python
rooms = [[1], [2], [3], []]
```

Execution:
- Start in room `0`, collect key `1`.
- Visit room `1`, collect key `2`.
- Visit room `2`, collect key `3`.
- Visit room `3`, no more keys.

Output: `True`

#### Example 2:
Input:
```python
rooms = [[1, 3], [3, 0, 1], [2], [0]]
```

Execution:
- Start in room `0`, collect keys `1` and `3`.
- Visit room `1`, collect keys `3`, `0`, and `1` (already visited).
- Visit room `3`, collect key `0` (already visited).
- Cannot access room `2`.

Output: `False`

To determine whether you can reach the last index of the array, we can use a **greedy approach**. The idea is to keep track of the farthest index we can reach as we iterate through the array.

### Approach:
1. We maintain a variable `maxReach` which keeps track of the farthest index we can jump to at any point.
2. For each index `i`, if `i` is within `maxReach` (i.e., `i <= maxReach`), then we update `maxReach` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]` (which is the farthest index we can reach from index `i`).
3. If at any point `maxReach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `True` (meaning we can reach the last index).
4. If we finish the loop and `maxReach` is less than the last index, return `False`.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize `maxReach = 0`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If `i` is greater than `maxReach`, return `False` (meaning we can't move forward).
   - Otherwise, update `maxReach` to the farthest index we can reach from the current index (`i + nums[i]`).
   - If at any point `maxReach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `True`.
3. After the loop, if `maxReach` is less than the last index, return `False`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def canJump(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    maxReach = 0

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i > maxReach:
            return False
        maxReach = max(maxReach, i + nums[i])
        if maxReach >= len(nums) - 1:
            return True

    return False
```

### Explanation:
1. We start by setting `maxReach` to 0, meaning initially we can only jump from index 0.
2. We loop through each index `i`:
   - If `i` is beyond the current `maxReach`, it means we can't reach that index, and hence it's impossible to reach the end.
   - Otherwise, we update `maxReach` by checking if jumping from the current index `i` allows us to reach farther than the current `maxReach`.
   - If at any point `maxReach` is greater than or equal to the last index, we return `True` because it means we can reach the last index.
3. If we finish the loop without being able to reach the last index, we return `False`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few variables.

### Example 1:

```python
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
print(canJump(nums))  # Output: True
```
Explanation:
- Start at index 0, maxReach = 2 (jump 1 step).
- At index 1, maxReach = 4 (jump 3 steps to the last index).

### Example 2:

```python
nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
print(canJump(nums))  # Output: False
```
Explanation:
- Start at index 0, maxReach = 3.
- At index 3, maxReach remains 3 (can't move beyond this point).
- Since `maxReach < len(nums) - 1`, return False.

This approach efficiently solves the problem in linear time by tracking the farthest index we can reach while iterating through the array.

This part of the code checks if the current position `i` is beyond the furthest point that can be reached (`maxReach`). Here's the breakdown:

### Context of the Problem:
The `canJump` function determines if you can reach the last index of the array `nums`. Each element in the array represents the maximum jump length you can make from that position.

### Explanation of `if i > maxReach: return False`:

- **`maxReach`** represents the farthest index you can currently reach. It is updated as you iterate through the array, considering the maximum jump from each position.

- **`i`** is the current index in the array, representing the position you're checking.

- The condition `if i > maxReach:` checks if the current index `i` is **greater** than the farthest index `maxReach` that you could have reached so far.

    - If `i` is **greater** than `maxReach`, it means you are trying to move beyond the range you are able to reach with the jumps allowed up to that point. In this case, you cannot proceed further, and it's **impossible** to reach the end of the array.

    - Therefore, the function returns `False` because you've encountered an index `i` that you can't reach, meaning you can't jump to the last index.

### Why is this check important?

The check ensures that as you move through the array, you aren't stuck at some position where you can no longer progress. If at any point `i > maxReach`, it confirms that you're blocked from reaching further indices, so there's no way to reach the last index. This immediately terminates the function early with `False`.

### Example:

For `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`:
- Starting at index 0, you can jump up to index 2 (`maxReach = 2`).
- At index 1, you can extend the max reach to index 4 (`maxReach = 4`), so you can eventually reach the last index.
- The function will return `True`.

For `nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]`:
- Starting at index 0, you can jump up to index 3 (`maxReach = 3`).
- At index 3, you can only reach index 3 because `nums[3] = 0`.
- When you reach index 4 (`i = 4`), it exceeds `maxReach = 3`, meaning you are blocked. Therefore, `i > maxReach` is `True`, and the function returns `False`.

To solve the problem of converting the string to a zigzag pattern and reading it row by row, we can break the task into a few clear steps.

### Approach:
1. **Special Case**: If `numRows` is 1, there is no zigzag, and we return the string as is.
2. **Simulating the Zigzag**: We need to simulate the process of writing the characters of the string into different rows, just like how the zigzag pattern works:
   - Move vertically down until reaching the bottom row.
   - Then, move diagonally up until reaching the top row.
   - Repeat this process until all characters in the string are placed in their respective rows.
3. **Concatenate the Rows**: After placing all the characters into their respective rows, we concatenate each row to form the final result.

### Key Observations:
- We need to track the current row we are adding characters to.
- We change direction when we hit the topmost or bottommost row.
- The number of rows can be as few as 1 or as many as the length of the string.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array (or list) of strings to represent the rows.
2. Traverse through the characters of the input string `s`, placing each character into the appropriate row.
3. Change direction when you reach either the top or the bottom row.
4. Finally, join all the rows to create the result.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        # Special case: if numRows is 1, return the original string
        if numRows == 1:
            return s

        # Create a list to store the rows
        rows = [''] * min(numRows, len(s))

        # Variables to track the current row and direction
        cur_row = 0
        going_down = False

        # Traverse through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # Add the current character to the current row
            rows[cur_row] += char

            # If we are at the top or bottom, change direction
            if cur_row == 0 or cur_row == numRows - 1:
                going_down = not going_down

            # Move to the next row
            cur_row += 1 if going_down else -1

        # Concatenate all rows and return the result
        return ''.join(rows)
```

### Explanation:
- **Base Case**: If `numRows` is 1, the string is returned as is since there is no zigzagging possible.
- **Rows List**: We create a list `rows` to hold strings for each row. The number of rows will be either `numRows` or the length of the string (whichever is smaller).
- **Direction Control**: The boolean `going_down` helps track whether we are moving downward or upward through the rows.
- **Traversing the String**: For each character in the string `s`, we add it to the current row, and then we adjust the row index (`cur_row`) based on the direction. If we reach the topmost or bottommost row, we reverse the direction.
- **Final Output**: We join the rows together and return the result.

### Example Walkthroughs:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "PAYPALISHIRING"`, `numRows = 3`
- Zigzag pattern:
  ```
  P   A   H   N
  A P L S I I G
  Y   I   R
  ```
- Output: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `s = "PAYPALISHIRING"`, `numRows = 4`
- Zigzag pattern:
  ```
  P     I    N
  A   L S  I G
  Y A   H R
  P     I
  ```
- Output: `"PINALSIGYAHRPI"`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `s = "A"`, `numRows = 1`
- Since thereâ€™s only one row, the output is simply `"A"`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once and perform constant time operations to add characters to rows.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The space is used to store the characters in different rows.

This algorithm efficiently simulates the zigzag process and constructs the output in linear time.

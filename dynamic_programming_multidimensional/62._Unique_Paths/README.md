This problem is a classic **Dynamic Programming** problem, where we calculate the number of unique paths in a grid. Below, I outline three common approaches: **Dynamic Programming (DP)**, **Combinatorics**, and a simple **Recursive** solution (though the latter is not efficient for larger grids).

---

### **Approach 1: Dynamic Programming**

The idea is to use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to cell `(i, j)`.

1. **Base Case**:
   - The first row (`dp[0][j]`) and the first column (`dp[i][0]`) have only one unique path because the robot can only move either right or down.
     - `dp[0][j] = 1` for all \( j \).
     - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all \( i \).

2. **Transition**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, the number of paths to reach it is the sum of the paths to the cell directly above it (`dp[i-1][j]`) and the cell directly to its left (`dp[i][j-1]`).
     - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`.

3. **Result**:
   - The value at the bottom-right corner, `dp[m-1][n-1]`, gives the number of unique paths.

---

### **Code Implementation (DP)**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Create a 2D DP table initialized with 0
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        # Fill the first row and first column with 1
        for i in range(m):
            dp[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][j] = 1

        # Fill the rest of the DP table
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

        # Return the value at the bottom-right corner
        return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

---

### **Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) — we iterate through all cells in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m \times n) \) — for the DP table.

To optimize space, we can use a **1D DP array** since each cell depends only on the current and previous rows.

---

### **Approach 2: Combinatorics**

The robot must make \( m-1 \) downward moves and \( n-1 \) rightward moves to reach the bottom-right corner. The total number of moves is \( (m+n-2) \), and we need to choose \( (m-1) \) downward moves (or \( (n-1) \) rightward moves).

The number of unique paths is given by the binomial coefficient:
\[
\text{Paths} = \binom{m+n-2}{m-1} = \frac{(m+n-2)!}{(m-1)!(n-1)!}
\]

---

### **Code Implementation (Combinatorics)**

We can compute this using Python's `math.factorial` or directly use `math.comb` for binomial coefficients.

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Compute the binomial coefficient
        return math.comb(m + n - 2, m - 1)
```

---

### **Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\min(m, n)) \) — for computing the factorials.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) — constant space usage.

This approach is faster and uses less memory compared to DP, especially for larger grids.

---

### **Approach 3: Recursive Solution (Inefficient for Large Grids)**

We can use recursion to explore all possible paths. At each step, the robot can either move right or down. The base cases are:
- If \( m == 1 \) or \( n == 1 \), there's only one path to the destination.

---

### **Code Implementation (Recursive)**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # Base case: Only one path if at the edge of the grid
        if m == 1 or n == 1:
            return 1
        # Recursive case: Sum of paths from moving right and moving down
        return self.uniquePaths(m-1, n) + self.uniquePaths(m, n-1)
```

---

### **Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: Exponential \( O(2^{m+n}) \) — due to redundant recursive calls.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(m + n) \) — for the recursion stack.

This is not efficient for larger grids and should be avoided.

---

### **Comparison of Approaches**

| Approach        | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity | Notes                        |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Dynamic Programming | \( O(m \times n) \) | \( O(m \times n) \) or \( O(n) \) | Most intuitive. Can be space-optimized. |
| Combinatorics    | \( O(\min(m, n)) \) | \( O(1) \)        | Fastest and most efficient.  |
| Recursion        | \( O(2^{m+n}) \)  | \( O(m + n) \)    | Inefficient for large grids. |

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `m = 3, n = 7`
- Total moves: \( m+n-2 = 8 \), Down moves: \( m-1 = 2 \).
- Paths = \( \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} = 28 \).

Output:
```plaintext
28
```

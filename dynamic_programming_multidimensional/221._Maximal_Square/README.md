To solve the problem of finding the largest square containing only `1`s in a given `m x n` binary matrix, we can use dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to compute the size of the largest square ending at each cell and then keep track of the maximum size found during the process.

### Approach:

1. **DP Array**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the size of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at cell `(i, j)`.
   - If `matrix[i][j] == '1'`, then `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the values from the left (`dp[i][j-1]`), top (`dp[i-1][j]`), and top-left diagonal (`dp[i-1][j-1]`), plus 1.
   - If `matrix[i][j] == '0'`, then `dp[i][j] = 0` (since no square can end here).

2. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize the first row and first column with the corresponding values from the matrix, as there can't be any square larger than 1x1 at those positions.

3. **Result**:
   - The result is the square of the maximum value in the `dp` array, which gives the area of the largest square of `1`s.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def maximalSquare(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0

    # Get matrix dimensions
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    # DP table initialization
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    max_side = 0  # Track the largest side of the square

    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                if i == 0 or j == 0:  # First row or first column
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])

    # The area of the largest square is side^2
    return max_side * max_side

# Example 1
matrix1 = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix1))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
matrix2 = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix2))  # Output: 1

# Example 3
matrix3 = [["0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix3))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation:

- **DP Table Calculation**:
  - We calculate `dp[i][j]` based on the minimum value from its neighboring cells (top, left, and top-left diagonal). This ensures that only squares composed entirely of `1`s are considered, and the minimum value ensures the square can expand.

- **Base Cases**:
  - For the first row (`i == 0`) and first column (`j == 0`), if the value is `'1'`, `dp[i][j]` is simply `1` since no larger square can form at those edges.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `matrix1 = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]`:

- After filling the `dp` table:
  ```
  dp = [[1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
  ```
  - The largest value in `dp` is `2`, so the largest square has side length `2`, and the area is `2 * 2 = 4`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the matrix. We visit each cell once to fill the DP table.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` for the `dp` table. We can optimize space by only keeping track of the current row and the previous row, reducing space complexity to `O(n)`.

### Conclusion:

This approach efficiently calculates the largest square containing only `1`s in the binary matrix using dynamic programming with a time complexity of `O(m * n)`.


To solve the problem of finding the largest square containing only `1`s using a **recursive approach** (with memoization to avoid recalculating results for overlapping subproblems), we need to break down the problem into smaller subproblems recursively.

### Recursive Approach Breakdown:
- For each cell in the matrix, if it's a `'1'`, we want to find the largest square whose bottom-right corner is that cell.
- The size of the square ending at a cell `(i, j)` is determined by the minimum size of squares ending at:
  1. Top neighbor `(i-1, j)`
  2. Left neighbor `(i, j-1)`
  3. Top-left neighbor `(i-1, j-1)`
- We take the minimum size from these neighbors and add 1 to account for the current cell `(i, j)`.

### Recursive Function:
- We will use a helper function `getMaxSquare(i, j)` that computes the largest square ending at `(i, j)`.
- This function will check if the current cell is a `1` or `0`. If it's `1`, we recursively calculate the maximum size of squares from the three neighbors mentioned above.

### Memoization:
- Since recursion might lead to overlapping subproblems, we use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems, i.e., `dp[i][j]` will store the size of the largest square ending at `(i, j)`.

### Base Case:
- If we are out of bounds or the current cell is `0`, return `0` because no square can end there.

### Recursive Code Implementation:

```python
def maximalSquare(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    # Memoization table to store the results of subproblems
    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    # Helper recursive function with memoization
    def getMaxSquare(i, j):
        # Base case: if out of bounds or matrix[i][j] == '0'
        if i < 0 or j < 0 or matrix[i][j] == '0':
            return 0

        # If already computed, return the stored value
        if dp[i][j] != -1:
            return dp[i][j]

        # Recursively calculate the largest square size ending at (i, j)
        top = getMaxSquare(i-1, j)
        left = getMaxSquare(i, j-1)
        top_left = getMaxSquare(i-1, j-1)

        # The current cell's largest square size is based on the smallest neighbor square
        dp[i][j] = min(top, left, top_left) + 1

        return dp[i][j]

    max_side = 0

    # Iterate through the matrix to calculate the largest square for each cell
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                max_side = max(max_side, getMaxSquare(i, j))

    # The area of the largest square is max_side * max_side
    return max_side * max_side

# Example 1
matrix1 = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix1))  # Output: 4

# Example 2
matrix2 = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix2))  # Output: 1

# Example 3
matrix3 = [["0"]]
print(maximalSquare(matrix3))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
- **Recursion with Memoization**: The function `getMaxSquare(i, j)` computes the largest square ending at each cell recursively. It checks the top, left, and top-left cells to determine how large the square at `(i, j)` can be, and memoizes the result to avoid redundant calculations.

- **Base Case**: If the index is out of bounds or the cell is `'0'`, the function returns `0`.

- **Recursion Formula**: The size of the largest square ending at `(i, j)` is given by:
  \[
  dp[i][j] = \min(\text{top}, \text{left}, \text{top-left}) + 1
  \]
  where `top = dp[i-1][j]`, `left = dp[i][j-1]`, and `top-left = dp[i-1][j-1]`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Each cell `(i, j)` is processed once, and the result is stored in the memoization table. Thus, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(m * n)` for the memoization table `dp`.

### Conclusion:
This recursive approach with memoization effectively solves the problem in `O(m * n)` time, providing an alternative to the iterative dynamic programming approach.



In this problem of finding the largest square of 1's in a binary matrix, we can use either a **memoization table** (typically a 2D array) or a **hash map** (dictionary) to store the intermediate results of subproblems during the recursive process. Both approaches store the results to avoid recalculating values, but they have different trade-offs in terms of space usage and access speed.

Let's compare the two:

### 1. **Memoization Table (2D Array)**

A **memoization table** is a 2D array where each entry `dp[i][j]` stores the size of the largest square ending at position `(i, j)` in the matrix.

#### Advantages:
- **Direct Index Access**: Accessing or updating `dp[i][j]` is done in constant time `O(1)` since the index positions in the 2D array directly correspond to the row `i` and column `j` in the matrix.
- **Memory Efficient for Dense Grids**: Since every entry in the matrix is used, and `dp[i][j]` is always required, the memory overhead is straightforward and minimal for storing results of the entire grid.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Fixed Size**: You need to preallocate a 2D array of the same size as the input matrix. For very sparse matrices where only a few values are non-zero, this can lead to unnecessary memory consumption.

#### Example:
```python
# Using a memoization table (2D array)
dp = [[-1 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
```
Here `dp[i][j]` directly stores the result of the recursive call for each matrix position `(i, j)`.

### 2. **Hash Map (Dictionary)**

A **hash map** (or dictionary) can also be used for memoization. Each key in the hash map represents a tuple `(i, j)` corresponding to a position in the matrix, and the value stores the result for that position.

#### Advantages:
- **Sparse Data Handling**: If the matrix is sparse (most of the cells are `0`s), using a hash map will only store the results for cells where calculations are needed, reducing unnecessary memory use. This is useful when a large part of the matrix does not require any computations.
- **Flexible Size**: The dictionary only grows as needed, storing values only for those `(i, j)` positions where computations are performed.

#### Disadvantages:
- **Slower Access**: Accessing or updating an entry in a dictionary has an average time complexity of `O(1)`, but with a slightly higher constant factor than direct index access in a 2D array due to hash computation and collision handling.
- **Potential Overhead**: Each key in the dictionary is a tuple `(i, j)`, which introduces a small additional memory overhead compared to using a 2D array, where indexing is implicit.

#### Example:
```python
# Using a hash map (dictionary)
dp = {}
dp[(i, j)] = value
```
In this case, `dp[(i, j)]` stores the result for the matrix position `(i, j)`.

### Comparison Summary:

| **Aspect**              | **Memoization Table (2D Array)** | **Hash Map (Dictionary)** |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Access Time**          | O(1) (very fast)                | O(1) (slightly slower due to hash operations) |
| **Memory Usage**         | Fixed size `O(m * n)`            | Flexible size, grows based on computed entries |
| **Best for**             | Dense matrices                  | Sparse matrices or when only a few positions are computed |
| **Ease of Use**          | Easy and straightforward         | Slightly more complex due to tuple key management |

### Which to Choose?

- **Memoization Table (2D Array)**: This is generally the better choice for this problem, especially when the matrix is densely populated (most cells are either `0` or `1`, and you expect computations for many cells). It provides faster access times and minimal overhead.

- **Hash Map (Dictionary)**: This approach is useful if you have a large, sparse matrix where only a few `1`s are scattered, so you don't want to allocate memory for the entire matrix. It can be more memory-efficient in those scenarios.

For this specific problem (finding the largest square of 1's), since the matrix is likely to be fully populated and you're typically working on most cells, a **memoization table (2D array)** is the more efficient and straightforward choice. However, in scenarios with large sparse grids or if you're dynamically computing only a subset of cells, a **hash map** could save memory at the cost of slightly slower access times.


Here is a solution for finding the largest square containing only `1`s in a binary matrix using a **hash map** (dictionary) to store intermediate results for memoization.

### Problem Breakdown:
- The idea is to use a recursive function with memoization to check each cell and determine the size of the largest square ending at that position.
- We use a hash map (`dp`) where each key is a tuple `(i, j)` representing the position in the matrix, and the value stores the size of the largest square ending at that position.

### Approach:
1. **Base Case**: If we're out of bounds, return 0.
2. **Recursive Case**: For each cell `matrix[i][j]`, check the size of the square that can be formed at the current position by considering the squares that end at the neighboring cells to the right `(i, j+1)`, below `(i+1, j)`, and diagonally right-down `(i+1, j+1)`.
3. **Memoization**: Use a hash map to store the results of already-computed subproblems so that you don’t need to recalculate them.

### Solution Code (Python):
```python
def maximalSquare(matrix):
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = {}  # Dictionary for memoization

    def helper(i, j):
        # Base case: if out of bounds or the cell is '0', return 0
        if i >= m or j >= n or matrix[i][j] == '0':
            return 0

        # If already computed, return the stored value
        if (i, j) in dp:
            return dp[(i, j)]

        # Recursively find the size of the square from the current cell
        down = helper(i + 1, j)
        right = helper(i, j + 1)
        diag = helper(i + 1, j + 1)

        # Size of the square ending at (i, j) is 1 + min of right, down, diag
        dp[(i, j)] = 1 + min(down, right, diag)

        return dp[(i, j)]

    max_square_length = 0

    # Iterate through each cell in the matrix
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == '1':  # Only consider cells with '1'
                max_square_length = max(max_square_length, helper(i, j))

    # Return the area of the largest square
    return max_square_length ** 2

# Example usage:
matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],
          ["1","0","1","1","1"],
          ["1","1","1","1","1"],
          ["1","0","0","1","0"]]

print(maximalSquare(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matrix**: Each element in the matrix is a `0` or `1`.
2. **Helper Function**:
   - `helper(i, j)` computes the size of the largest square ending at position `(i, j)`.
   - It checks the size of squares in three directions: down (`(i+1, j)`), right (`(i, j+1)`), and diagonal (`(i+1, j+1)`).
   - The current cell can form a square if it is `1`, and the size is `1 + min(down, right, diag)`.
3. **Memoization**: The hash map `dp` stores the result of `helper(i, j)` so that it is computed only once for each cell.
4. **Result**: After checking all cells, the size of the largest square is returned as `max_square_length ** 2`, which gives the area.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Each cell is visited once, and the recursive calls with memoization ensure that each subproblem is solved only once. Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.

- **Space Complexity**: The hash map `dp` can store up to `m * n` entries, so the space complexity is also `O(m * n)`.

This approach efficiently computes the largest square containing only `1`s using recursion with memoization in a hash map, handling even sparse matrices well.

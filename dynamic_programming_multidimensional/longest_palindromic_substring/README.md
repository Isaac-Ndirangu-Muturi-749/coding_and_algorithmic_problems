To solve the problem of finding the **longest palindromic substring** in a given string `s`, we can use a **center expansion** technique. This approach explores all potential centers of the palindrome and expands outward to check for the longest palindrome.

### Key Observations:
1. A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
2. A palindrome can have either:
   - An odd length (centered at one character).
   - An even length (centered between two characters).
3. We can expand from each possible center (single character or between two characters) to find the longest palindrome.

### Approach:
1. For each character in the string (and each pair of consecutive characters), treat it as the center of a potential palindrome.
2. Expand outward from the center while the characters on both sides are equal.
3. Keep track of the longest palindrome found during the expansion process.

### Steps:
1. Loop through each index `i` in the string `s` and treat it as the center.
   - Expand outward for both odd-length and even-length palindromes.
2. Track the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found.
3. Return the substring corresponding to the longest palindrome.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if not s:
            return ""

        def expandFromCenter(left: int, right: int) -> str:
            # Expand as long as the characters on both sides are equal
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            # Return the longest palindrome substring found during this expansion
            return s[left + 1:right]

        longest_palindrome = ""

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Check for odd-length palindrome (centered at one character)
            odd_palindrome = expandFromCenter(i, i)
            if len(odd_palindrome) > len(longest_palindrome):
                longest_palindrome = odd_palindrome

            # Check for even-length palindrome (centered between two characters)
            even_palindrome = expandFromCenter(i, i + 1)
            if len(even_palindrome) > len(longest_palindrome):
                longest_palindrome = even_palindrome

        return longest_palindrome
```

### Explanation:
1. **expandFromCenter function**:
   - This function takes two indices, `left` and `right`, and expands outward as long as the characters at `left` and `right` are equal (i.e., the substring is still a palindrome).
   - It returns the longest palindromic substring found during the expansion.

2. **Main loop**:
   - For each character in the string `s`, we call `expandFromCenter` twice:
     - Once treating `i` as the center of an odd-length palindrome.
     - Once treating `i` and `i + 1` as the center of an even-length palindrome.
   - We update the `longest_palindrome` variable if a longer palindrome is found.

3. **Edge cases**:
   - If the string `s` is empty, we return an empty string.
   - If the string has one character, it is a palindrome itself.

### Example 1:
Input: `s = "babad"`

- Expand around center `i = 0` (character `b`):
  - Odd palindrome: `"bab"`.
- Expand around center `i = 1` (character `a`):
  - Odd palindrome: `"aba"`.
- Continue expanding, the longest palindrome found is `"bab"` (or `"aba"`).

Output: `"bab"` or `"aba"`.

### Example 2:
Input: `s = "cbbd"`

- Expand around center `i = 1` (between `b` and `b`):
  - Even palindrome: `"bb"`.

Output: `"bb"`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: For each character in the string, we expand from the center, which takes linear time. Since there are `n` characters, the overall complexity is quadratic.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** for storing the indices of the longest palindrome (excluding the input and output).



Let's break down the `expandFromCenter` function step by step:

### Purpose
The goal of this function is to find the longest palindromic substring that can be expanded from a given "center" point in a string `s`. It checks both sides of the center to see if the characters match and expands as long as the characters on the left and right sides are equal, which indicates a palindrome.

### Input
- `left` and `right`: These are the indices that represent the "center" from which we will expand outwards. This center can either be:
  - A single character (if `left == right`), which is the case for odd-length palindromes.
  - Two adjacent characters (if `left == right - 1`), which is the case for even-length palindromes.

### Core Logic

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The function starts expanding with the `left` and `right` pointers at their initial positions.
   - The `while` loop ensures that expansion continues as long as:
     - `left` is within the bounds of the string (`left >= 0`).
     - `right` is within the bounds of the string (`right < len(s)`).
     - The characters at `s[left]` and `s[right]` are equal, i.e., `s[left] == s[right]`, meaning the substring between `left` and `right` is a palindrome.

2. **Expansion**:
   - In each iteration of the loop, the `left` pointer is moved one step to the left (`left -= 1`), and the `right` pointer is moved one step to the right (`right += 1`), expanding the range being checked for the palindrome.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop stops when one of the following occurs:
     - `left` goes out of bounds (`left < 0`).
     - `right` goes out of bounds (`right >= len(s)`).
     - The characters at `s[left]` and `s[right]` are no longer equal, meaning the substring is no longer a palindrome.

4. **Return Value**:
   - Once the loop terminates, the function returns the substring that was found to be palindromic. This is done by slicing the string `s` from `left + 1` to `right`.
     - `left + 1`: This is because in the last loop iteration, `left` was decremented once more after finding the palindrome, so we need to adjust it by adding 1 to get the correct starting index of the palindrome.
     - `right`: This remains as-is because string slicing in Python is inclusive of the start index and exclusive of the end index, so no adjustment is needed.

### Example Walkthrough
Let’s say the input string is `"abacdfgfdcaba"`, and you start with `left = 2` and `right = 2`, trying to expand from the center character `"a"` (odd-length palindrome):

- First iteration: `s[2] == s[2]` (both are `"a"`) — expand, so `left = 1`, `right = 3`.
- Second iteration: `s[1] == s[3]` (both are `"b"`) — expand again, so `left = 0`, `right = 4`.
- Third iteration: `s[0] == s[4]` (both are `"a"`) — expand further, so `left = -1`, `right = 5`.
- Now, `left` is out of bounds (`left < 0`), so the loop stops.
- The function returns `s[0:5]`, which is `"ababa"` — the longest palindrome centered at index 2.

### Key Points:
- **Time complexity**: Each time the function is called, it potentially checks every character between `left` and `right`, making it O(n) in the worst case.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because no additional data structures are used besides a few variables for the indices. However, returning the substring might use O(k) space where `k` is the length of the palindrome.




Yes, we can solve the problem of finding the **longest palindromic substring** using **multidimensional dynamic programming (DP)**. This approach involves constructing a DP table that keeps track of whether each substring of the input string is a palindrome.

### Approach:
1. **DP Table**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be a boolean value indicating whether the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
   - The base case is that any single character `s[i]` is trivially a palindrome, so `dp[i][i] = True`.
   - A substring of length 2 is a palindrome if both characters are equal, i.e., `s[i] == s[i+1]`.
   - For substrings longer than 2 characters, `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome if `s[i] == s[j]` and the substring `s[i+1:j]` is also a palindrome, which is represented by `dp[i+1][j-1]`.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Start with small substrings and build up to larger substrings.
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `i <= j`, check if `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome by using the recursive relation mentioned above.

3. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome**:
   - Keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindrome found during the DP table construction.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
2. Iterate over all substrings, and for each substring, determine if it is a palindrome using the recursive relation.
3. Track the longest palindrome found and return the corresponding substring.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return ""

        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

        start, max_len = 0, 1  # Start index and length of the longest palindrome found

        # Every single character is a palindrome
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = True

        # Check for two-character palindromes
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                dp[i][i + 1] = True
                start = i
                max_len = 2

        # Check for palindromes of length 3 or more
        for length in range(3, n + 1):  # Length of the substring
            for i in range(n - length + 1):
                j = i + length - 1  # Ending index of the current substring
                if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    start = i
                    max_len = length

        # Return the longest palindrome substring
        return s[start:start + max_len]
```

### Explanation:
1. **DP Initialization**:
   - We initialize a 2D DP table `dp` of size `n x n` where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Each entry `dp[i][j]` is initially set to `False`.
   - We then mark `dp[i][i] = True` for every `i` because a single character is always a palindrome.

2. **Handling Substrings of Length 2**:
   - We check each pair of consecutive characters `s[i]` and `s[i+1]`. If they are equal, then the substring `s[i:i+2]` is a palindrome, and we mark `dp[i][i+1] = True`.

3. **Filling the DP Table for Larger Substrings**:
   - For each substring length starting from 3, we check all possible starting indices `i` and compute the ending index `j` for the current substring. If `s[i] == s[j]` and the inner substring `s[i+1:j]` is a palindrome (i.e., `dp[i+1][j-1]` is `True`), then `s[i:j+1]` is also a palindrome, and we mark `dp[i][j] = True`.

4. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome**:
   - While filling the DP table, we update the starting index `start` and the maximum length `max_len` whenever a longer palindrome is found.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - After the DP table is fully populated, the longest palindromic substring is `s[start:start + max_len]`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `s = "babad"`

1. Initialize `dp[i][i] = True` for all `i`, so each single character is a palindrome.
2. For substrings of length 2, `"ba"`, `"ab"`, and `"ad"` are not palindromes, but `"bab"` and `"aba"` are palindromes of length 3.
3. The longest palindrome found is `"bab"` (or `"aba"`).

Output: `"bab"` or `"aba"`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `s = "cbbd"`

1. Initialize `dp[i][i] = True` for all `i`.
2. For substrings of length 2, `"bb"` is a palindrome.
3. The longest palindrome found is `"bb"`.

Output: `"bb"`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: We fill the DP table of size `n x n`, and for each entry `dp[i][j]`, we perform a constant amount of work.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: We use a 2D DP table of size `n x n`.

### Conclusion:
Using a DP-based approach ensures that we correctly handle all possible substrings and efficiently find the longest palindromic substring in O(n^2) time and space. Although it is not as fast as the **center expansion** method in practice, it is a robust and systematic approach for solving the problem.



Let's break down this part of the code, which is often used to solve the **Longest Palindromic Substring** problem using **Dynamic Programming**.

### Purpose:
This code snippet is part of a larger function that uses dynamic programming to find the **longest palindromic substring** in a given string `s`. Specifically, it deals with substrings of increasing lengths, starting from length 3, and determines if they are palindromes.

### Explanation:
- **Outer loop: `for length in range(3, n + 1)`**
  - This loop iterates over different lengths of substrings, starting from length 3 up to `n`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
  - Why start from 3? Because we assume palindromes of length 1 and 2 are already handled earlier in the code. Length 1 is always a palindrome, and length 2 palindromes can be directly checked by comparing two adjacent characters.
  - So, this loop checks substrings of increasing lengths (3, 4, 5, ...).

- **Inner loop: `for i in range(n - length + 1)`**
  - This loop sets the starting index `i` for the current substring.
  - `n - length + 1` ensures that the substring starting at `i` will have the correct length (`length`), without going out of bounds.
  - Example: For a string of length 6 (`n = 6`), if you're checking substrings of length 3, the inner loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (`n - 3 + 1 = 4`), which gives substrings `s[0:3]`, `s[1:4]`, `s[2:5]`, and `s[3:6]`.

- **`j = i + length - 1`**
  - `j` is the ending index of the current substring. It is computed as `i + length - 1` because `i` is the starting index, and the length of the substring is `length`, so the ending index is `i + (length - 1)`.

- **Checking if the substring is a palindrome: `if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]`**
  - First, check if the characters at the start (`s[i]`) and end (`s[j]`) of the substring are the same. If they are not the same, the substring cannot be a palindrome.
  - Second, check if the substring `s[i + 1:j]` (the part between `s[i]` and `s[j]`) is already known to be a palindrome. This is stored in `dp[i + 1][j - 1]`. If it is `True`, then the entire substring `s[i:j + 1]` is a palindrome.
  - The `dp` array is a 2D table where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.

- **`dp[i][j] = True`**
  - If both conditions above are met (i.e., `s[i] == s[j]` and the substring `s[i+1:j]` is a palindrome), then the substring `s[i:j+1]` is also a palindrome, so set `dp[i][j]` to `True`.

- **Update `start` and `max_len`:**
  - `start = i`: This updates the starting index of the longest palindrome found so far.
  - `max_len = length`: This updates the length of the longest palindrome found so far.
  - Every time a longer palindrome is found, these values are updated.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let’s say the input string is `s = "abcbab"`, and you are in the process of checking substrings of length 3 (i.e., the first iteration of the outer loop).

1. For `i = 0`, `j = 2` (substring `s[0:3] = "abc"`):
   - `s[0] != s[2]` (since `'a'` is not equal to `'c'`), so this is not a palindrome.

2. For `i = 1`, `j = 3` (substring `s[1:4] = "bcb"`):
   - `s[1] == s[3]` (both are `'b'`), and `dp[2][2]` (the substring `"c"`) is `True` because a single character is always a palindrome.
   - So, `dp[1][3] = True`, meaning `s[1:4] = "bcb"` is a palindrome.
   - Update `start = 1` and `max_len = 3`.

3. For `i = 2`, `j = 4` (substring `s[2:5] = "cba"`):
   - `s[2] != s[4]` (since `'c'` is not equal to `'a'`), so this is not a palindrome.

4. For `i = 3`, `j = 5` (substring `s[3:6] = "bab"`):
   - `s[3] == s[5]` (both are `'b'`), and `dp[4][4]` (the substring `"a"`) is `True`.
   - So, `dp[3][5] = True`, meaning `s[3:6] = "bab"` is a palindrome.
   - Since the length of `"bab"` is the same as `"bcb"`, `start` and `max_len` can be updated or left as is depending on the code.

### Final Output:
After all iterations, `start` and `max_len` will hold the starting index and length of the longest palindromic substring found, which can then be returned as the result.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this code is **O(n²)** because there are two nested loops: the outer loop runs for each possible substring length, and the inner loop checks all starting indices for that length.

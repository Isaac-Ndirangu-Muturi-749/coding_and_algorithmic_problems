To count the nodes in a **complete binary tree** in less than \(O(n)\) time complexity, we can leverage the properties of a complete binary tree. The key idea is to use binary search along with the structure of the tree.

### **Python Implementation**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        """
        Counts the number of nodes in a complete binary tree using a logarithmic approach.
        """
        if not root:
            return 0

        # Get the height of the leftmost and rightmost paths
        def get_tree_depth(node):
            depth = 0
            while node:
                depth += 1
                node = node.left
            return depth

        left_depth = get_tree_depth(root.left)
        right_depth = get_tree_depth(root.right)

        if left_depth == right_depth:
            # Left subtree is perfect; its size is 2^left_depth - 1 plus the root
            return (1 << left_depth) + self.countNodes(root.right)
        else:
            # Right subtree is perfect; its size is 2^right_depth - 1 plus the root
            return (1 << right_depth) + self.countNodes(root.left)
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Tree Depth**:
   - Use a helper function `get_tree_depth` to calculate the depth of the leftmost and rightmost paths. This tells us if a subtree is complete.

2. **Complete Tree Properties**:
   - If the depths of the left and right subtrees are equal, the left subtree is a **perfect binary tree**. Its size is \(2^{\text{left\_depth}} - 1\). Add the root node and recursively count the nodes in the right subtree.
   - If the depths differ, the right subtree is a **perfect binary tree**. Its size is \(2^{\text{right\_depth}} - 1\). Add the root node and recursively count the nodes in the left subtree.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If the root is `None`, return 0.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach avoids visiting every node explicitly. Instead, it uses the tree height, reducing the time complexity to \(O(\log^2 n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes. The depth calculation takes \(O(\log n)\), and at each level of recursion, there are \(O(\log n)\) levels.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log^2 n)\)
  - Calculating depth is \(O(\log n)\).
  - Recursion runs \(O(\log n)\) times.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\)
  - Due to the recursive stack.

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4  5 6
```

- **Step 1**:
  - Left depth: 3 (1 → 2 → 4).
  - Right depth: 2 (1 → 3).
  - Recurse into the left subtree.

- **Step 2**:
  - Left depth: 2 (2 → 4).
  - Right depth: 2 (2 → 5).
  - Left subtree is perfect: \(2^2 - 1 = 3\).
  - Total nodes: \(3 + 1 + \text{recurse on right subtree}\).

- **Final**:
  - Return \(6\).

Output: **6**

This method efficiently counts the nodes without traversing the entire tree.


The line:

```python
return (1 << left_depth) + self.countNodes(root.right)
```

is part of an optimized algorithm to count the nodes in a **complete binary tree**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Understanding the Key Elements:**

1. **`1 << left_depth`**:
   - The expression `1 << left_depth` is equivalent to \(2^{\text{left\_depth}}\).
   - It computes the total number of nodes in a **perfect binary tree** of height `left_depth`.
     - For example, if `left_depth = 3`, \(2^3 = 8\), which means there are 8 nodes in a perfect binary tree of height 3.
   - This is efficient because we avoid traversing every node to count them—it's a direct calculation.

2. **`self.countNodes(root.right)`**:
   - This is a recursive call to count the nodes in the right subtree of the current root.
   - The algorithm shifts focus to the right subtree when the left subtree is a perfect binary tree.

3. **Adding the results**:
   - The left subtree contributes \(2^{\text{left\_depth}}\) nodes.
   - The right subtree is counted recursively.
   - Summing these gives the total node count.

---

### **Why this works:**
- A **complete binary tree** is almost perfect:
  - All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- By checking the depths of the leftmost and rightmost paths, we can determine:
  - If the **left subtree** is a perfect binary tree, its nodes can be calculated in \(O(1)\).
  - Recursively count the remaining nodes in the **right subtree**.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Input Tree (height = 3):**
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   /
   4   5 6
```

#### **Step-by-step Execution:**
1. **At root (Node 1):**
   - `left_depth = 3` (path: `1 -> 2 -> 4`).
   - `right_depth = 2` (path: `1 -> 3 -> 6`).

   Since `left_depth > right_depth`, the left subtree is **perfect** with \(2^{\text{left\_depth} - 1} = 2^2 = 4\) nodes.
   - Result: `4 (left) + self.countNodes(root.right)`

2. **At root.right (Node 3):**
   - `left_depth = 2` (path: `3 -> 6`).
   - `right_depth = 1` (path: `3 -> None`).

   Again, the left subtree of Node 3 is **perfect** with \(2^{\text{left\_depth} - 1} = 2^1 = 2\) nodes.
   - Result: `2 (left) + self.countNodes(root.right)`

3. **At root.right.right (Node 6):**
   - `left_depth = 1`, `right_depth = 1` (both paths lead to `None`).

   This is a **perfect binary tree** with \(2^{\text{left\_depth} - 1} = 2^0 = 1\) node.
   - Result: `1`

#### **Final Calculation:**
- At Node 6: `1`
- At Node 3: `2 (left) + 1 = 3`
- At Node 1: `4 (left) + 3 = 7`

Total nodes = **7**

### **Efficiency**
This approach avoids traversing all nodes and instead uses depth calculations and recursion, achieving a time complexity of \(O(\log^2 N)\).

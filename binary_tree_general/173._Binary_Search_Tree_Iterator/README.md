Hereâ€™s how to implement the `BSTIterator` class efficiently using a stack to simulate the in-order traversal. This approach satisfies the requirements of \(O(h)\) memory, where \(h\) is the height of the BST, and \(O(1)\) average time complexity for `next()` and `hasNext()` calls.

### **Python Implementation**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class BSTIterator:
    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):
        """
        Initialize the iterator with the root of the BST.
        """
        self.stack = []
        self._push_left(root)  # Populate the stack with the leftmost nodes.

    def _push_left(self, node: TreeNode):
        """
        Helper function to push all the leftmost nodes of a subtree to the stack.
        """
        while node:
            self.stack.append(node)
            node = node.left

    def next(self) -> int:
        """
        Return the next smallest number in the BST.
        """
        # Pop the top element from the stack.
        curr = self.stack.pop()
        # If the current node has a right child, process its leftmost subtree.
        if curr.right:
            self._push_left(curr.right)
        return curr.val

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        """
        Return True if there are more nodes to traverse, otherwise False.
        """
        return len(self.stack) > 0
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Initialization**:
   - The constructor initializes the stack and pushes all leftmost nodes from the root into the stack. This ensures that the smallest element is at the top of the stack.

2. **`next()`**:
   - Pop the top node from the stack, which represents the next smallest element.
   - If this node has a right child, push all the leftmost nodes of its right subtree to the stack.

3. **`hasNext()`**:
   - Simply checks if the stack is non-empty. If it is, there are more elements to process.

### **Example Walkthrough**

For the BST:
```
        7
       / \
      3   15
          /  \
         9    20
```

#### Initialization:
- The stack will contain `[7, 3]` (leftmost nodes).

#### Sequence of Operations:
1. `next()`:
   - Pop `3` from the stack (smallest element).
   - Stack now: `[7]`.

2. `next()`:
   - Pop `7` from the stack.
   - Push leftmost nodes of `15`: Stack becomes `[15, 9]`.

3. `hasNext()`:
   - Returns `True` (stack is not empty).

4. `next()`:
   - Pop `9` from the stack.
   - Stack now: `[15]`.

5. `hasNext()`:
   - Returns `True`.

6. `next()`:
   - Pop `15` from the stack.
   - Push leftmost nodes of `20`: Stack becomes `[20]`.

7. `hasNext()`:
   - Returns `True`.

8. `next()`:
   - Pop `20` from the stack.
   - Stack now: `[]`.

9. `hasNext()`:
   - Returns `False`.

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `next()`:
    - Average: \(O(1)\), as each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
    - Worst: \(O(h)\) when traversing a right subtree.
  - `hasNext()`:
    - \(O(1)\), as it only checks the stack size.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, as the stack contains the nodes along the path to the current node.

This implementation is efficient and meets the constraints for the problem.

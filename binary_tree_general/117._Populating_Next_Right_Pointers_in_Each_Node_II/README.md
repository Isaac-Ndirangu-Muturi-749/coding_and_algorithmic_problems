Here's how to implement the solution in Python for populating the `next` pointers in a binary tree.

### **Approach 1: Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)**
Using a queue, we traverse the tree level by level and connect nodes at each level.

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None

        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            size = len(queue)
            prev = None

            for _ in range(size):
                curr = queue.popleft()

                if prev:
                    prev.next = curr
                prev = curr

                if curr.left:
                    queue.append(curr.left)
                if curr.right:
                    queue.append(curr.right)

        return root
```

---

### **Approach 2: Constant Space Traversal (Iterative Solution)**
This approach avoids using extra space by utilizing the `next` pointers already present in the tree.

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return None

        curr = root  # Start from the root

        while curr:
            dummy = Node(0)  # Dummy node to track the next level
            tail = dummy

            # Traverse the current level
            while curr:
                if curr.left:
                    tail.next = curr.left
                    tail = tail.next
                if curr.right:
                    tail.next = curr.right
                    tail = tail.next
                curr = curr.next  # Move to the next node in the current level

            # Move to the next level
            curr = dummy.next

        return root
```

---

### **Approach 3: Recursive Solution**
A recursive approach works by connecting nodes level by level. This method uses the call stack for recursion, which is acceptable as per the problem's constraints.

```python
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root or (not root.left and not root.right):
            return root

        if root.left:
            root.left.next = root.right

        if root.right and root.next:
            root.right.next = root.next.left

        self.connect(root.left)
        self.connect(root.right)

        return root
```

### Example Walkthrough
For the binary tree:
```
      1
    /   \
   2     3
  / \      \
 4   5      7
```
- **Level 1**: `1 -> NULL`
- **Level 2**: `2 -> 3 -> NULL`
- **Level 3**: `4 -> 5 -> 7 -> NULL`

All the approaches ensure the `next` pointers are set as above.


The code is solving the problem of connecting all nodes at the same level in a binary tree. Letâ€™s break it down step by step to understand how it works and how the traversal happens.

---

### **How It Works**
The algorithm uses a **level-by-level traversal (similar to BFS)** without explicitly using a queue. Instead, it utilizes a `dummy` node to build the "next level" as it traverses the "current level."

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **`curr`:**
   - Tracks the node currently being processed at the current level.

2. **`dummy`:**
   - A placeholder node that helps to link all nodes of the next level. It ensures the traversal order for the next level is maintained.

3. **`tail`:**
   - Keeps track of the last node added to the next level. This is updated as the algorithm connects child nodes.

4. **Level Traversal:**
   - The outer `while curr` loop ensures that the algorithm processes each level of the tree.

5. **Node Linking:**
   - The inner `while curr` loop connects the `left` and `right` children of each node at the current level to form the next level.

---

### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough with Example**

#### Input Tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```

---

#### **Initialization:**

- `curr` starts at the root (Node `1`).
- `dummy` is a temporary node to create the next level's linked list.
- `tail` initially points to `dummy`.

---

#### **Outer Loop (Level 1):**

- `curr` = Node `1`.

---

##### **Inner Loop (Process Node `1`):**

1. **Left Child:**
   - Node `1` has a left child, `2`.
   - `tail.next = curr.left` connects `dummy -> 2`.
   - Update `tail` to `2`.

2. **Right Child:**
   - Node `1` has a right child, `3`.
   - `tail.next = curr.right` connects `2 -> 3`.
   - Update `tail` to `3`.

3. **Move to Next Node:**
   - `curr = curr.next` (Node `1` has no `next`, so `curr = None`).

---

- End of Level 1:
  - Next level linked list: `2 -> 3`.
  - Update `curr = dummy.next` (Node `2`).

---

#### **Outer Loop (Level 2):**

- `curr` = Node `2`.

---

##### **Inner Loop (Process Node `2`):**

1. **Left Child:**
   - Node `2` has a left child, `4`.
   - `tail.next = curr.left` connects `dummy -> 4`.
   - Update `tail` to `4`.

2. **Right Child:**
   - Node `2` has a right child, `5`.
   - `tail.next = curr.right` connects `4 -> 5`.
   - Update `tail` to `5`.

3. **Move to Next Node:**
   - `curr = curr.next` (Node `3`).

---

##### **Inner Loop (Process Node `3`):**

1. **Left Child:**
   - Node `3` has a left child, `6`.
   - `tail.next = curr.left` connects `5 -> 6`.
   - Update `tail` to `6`.

2. **Right Child:**
   - Node `3` has a right child, `7`.
   - `tail.next = curr.right` connects `6 -> 7`.
   - Update `tail` to `7`.

3. **Move to Next Node:**
   - `curr = curr.next` (Node `3` has no `next`, so `curr = None`).

---

- End of Level 2:
  - Next level linked list: `4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7`.
  - Update `curr = dummy.next` (Node `4`).

---

#### **Outer Loop (Level 3):**

- `curr` = Node `4`.

---

##### **Inner Loop:**
- Nodes `4`, `5`, `6`, and `7` have no children.
- No connections are made at this level.
- `curr = curr.next` until `curr = None`.

---

#### **End of Traversal:**
- No more levels to process (`curr = None`).

---

### **Final Tree with Connections:**

```
        1 -> None
      /   \
     2  -> 3 -> None
    / \   / \
   4->5->6->7 -> None
```

---

### **Summary of Key Actions:**

1. **Traverse each level:** Using `curr` to iterate through the current level.
2. **Build the next level:** Use `dummy` and `tail` to construct the `next` pointers for the next level.
3. **Move to the next level:** Update `curr = dummy.next` after processing a level.

This approach ensures that all levels are connected without using additional space beyond the `dummy` node and pointers.

At `3.next`, the following happens:

- When processing **Node 3**, its **`next` pointer** is already `None` because it is the last node of Level 2 (constructed during the traversal of Level 1).

- After processing Node 3:
  1. **Its children (`6` and `7`) are linked to the next level.**
     - `5 -> 6` (connected when Node 2 was processed).
     - `6 -> 7` (connected while processing Node 3).
  2. **Node 3 has no sibling (i.e., no `next` node).**
     - Therefore, `curr = curr.next` results in `curr = None`, signaling the end of Level 2.

In short, **`3.next` is already `None`**, as Node 3 is the rightmost node of its level. After processing Node 3, the algorithm completes Level 2 and moves to Level 3 using `curr = dummy.next`. At this point, `dummy.next` points to Node `4`, the leftmost node of the next level.

To efficiently count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree in less than O(n) time, we can take advantage of the properties of a complete binary tree:

1. **Complete Binary Tree Characteristics**:
   - All levels are fully filled except for the last level.
   - The last level is filled from left to right.
   - The height of a complete binary tree is determined by the longest path from the root to a leaf.

2. **Optimal Approach**:
   - The key to the solution is to leverage the tree's structure and calculate the height of the leftmost and rightmost subtrees.
   - If the left and right subtree heights are the same, the tree is a perfect binary tree up to that level, and we can calculate the total number of nodes directly as \(2^{\text{height}} - 1\).
   - If the heights differ, the problem can be reduced to counting nodes recursively in one of the subtrees.

### Approach:
- **Calculate Height**: Write a helper function to compute the height of the tree from the leftmost node.
- **Recursive Approach**:
   - If the left subtree height is equal to the right subtree height, the left subtree is a perfect binary tree. Hence, its size is \(2^{\text{height}} - 1\), and we proceed to the right subtree.
   - If the heights differ, the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height \(h-1\), and we compute its size while recursing on the left subtree.

### Algorithm:
1. **Height Function**: This computes the height of the tree starting from the root by traversing the leftmost nodes.
2. **Node Counting**: The recursive function will compare the heights of the left and right subtrees and decide whether to recurse on the left or right subtree.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def countNodes(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    # Helper function to compute the height of the tree
    def compute_height(node):
        height = 0
        while node:
            height += 1
            node = node.left  # Go to the leftmost node
        return height

    if not root:
        return 0

    # Compute the left and right subtree heights
    left_height = compute_height(root.left)
    right_height = compute_height(root.right)

    if left_height == right_height:
        # If left and right subtree heights are the same, it's a perfect binary tree
        # on the left side. Therefore, we use 2^left_height - 1 for the left subtree nodes
        # plus 1 (the root) plus the nodes in the right subtree.
        return (1 << left_height) + countNodes(root.right)
    else:
        # If the left and right subtree heights are different, the right subtree is a perfect
        # binary tree of height right_height. We use 2^right_height - 1 for the right subtree nodes
        # plus 1 (the root) plus the nodes in the left subtree.
        return (1 << right_height) + countNodes(root.left)
```

### Explanation:
1. **compute_height(node)**:
   - This function calculates the height of the subtree by traversing the leftmost nodes.
   - The height is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf.

2. **countNodes(root)**:
   - If the tree is empty (`root == None`), return 0.
   - The heights of the left and right subtrees are computed:
     - If the heights are equal, the left subtree is a perfect binary tree, and its size can be computed as \(2^{\text{left\_height}} - 1\). Add 1 for the root, then recurse on the right subtree.
     - If the heights are not equal, the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height \(h-1\). Compute its size as \(2^{\text{right\_height}} - 1\) and recurse on the left subtree.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
The tree is:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6

Step 1: Compute left and right heights.
    Left height = 3 (nodes 1 → 2 → 4)
    Right height = 2 (nodes 1 → 3)

Since left height != right height, we know the right subtree is perfect. We compute:
    2^2 - 1 = 3 nodes in the right subtree.

Recursively count nodes in the left subtree.
    Subtree rooted at node 2 has left and right heights both equal to 2, so it's a perfect binary tree.
    2^2 - 1 = 3 nodes in the left subtree.

Final count: 3 (right subtree) + 3 (left subtree) + 1 (root) = 6 nodes.
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: root = []
Output: 0
Explanation: The tree is empty, so there are no nodes.
```

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tree consists of a single node.
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log^2 n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - In each recursive step, we compute the height of the tree, which takes O(log n). Since we halve the problem size at each step, the overall complexity is O(log^2 n).

- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) due to the recursion stack.

This approach efficiently counts the nodes in a complete binary tree in less than O(n) time by leveraging the tree's structure and properties.


This line of code is part of an algorithm to **count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree** more efficiently than a simple traversal.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the line:

### `1 << left_height`:
- This is a **bitwise left shift** operation.
- The expression `1 << left_height` shifts the number `1` to the left by `left_height` positions in binary.
- Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing `2^left_height`.

#### Example:
- If `left_height = 3`, then `1 << 3` is equal to `2^3 = 8`.

This means that `1 << left_height` calculates the number of nodes in a **perfect binary tree** of height `left_height` (since a perfect binary tree of height `h` has `2^h - 1` nodes, and the left subtree of a complete binary tree may be such a perfect tree).

### `countNodes(root.right)`:
- This is a **recursive call** to count the number of nodes in the right subtree of the root.
- The function `countNodes` counts the nodes in the right subtree.

### Combining the Two:
- The left subtree of the root is a **perfect binary tree** with `left_height` nodes, so it contains exactly `1 << left_height` nodes.
- After counting all the nodes in the left subtree, the algorithm proceeds to count the nodes in the right subtree recursively.
- The total number of nodes is the sum of the nodes in the left subtree (`1 << left_height`), plus the number of nodes in the right subtree (`countNodes(root.right)`), and the root node (implicitly included in the recursion).

### Complete Breakdown of the Algorithm's Logic:
1. **Check the height of the left subtree** (`left_height`) and assume it forms a perfect binary tree.
2. The number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height `left_height` is `2^left_height` (`1 << left_height`).
3. Recursively count the nodes in the **right subtree**.
4. The total number of nodes in the complete binary tree is the sum of:
   - Nodes in the left subtree (`1 << left_height`).
   - Nodes in the right subtree (`countNodes(root.right)`).

### Why Use This Approach?
This method helps reduce the time complexity. Instead of counting every node (which takes O(n)), the algorithm exploits the structure of the **complete binary tree** (where one subtree is a perfect binary tree) to avoid visiting every node. This reduces the complexity to **O(log(n)²)** by counting the number of nodes in one part directly based on its height and recursively dealing with the other part.


In the context of a **complete binary tree**, counting the height of the left and right subtrees plays a critical role in determining the structure of the tree. A **complete binary tree** is a tree where every level except the last is fully filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible in the last level. This unique structure allows for more efficient node counting than in a regular binary tree.

### Difference between counting the **left** and **right** subtree heights:

1. **Left Subtree Height (`left_height`)**:
   - When calculating the height of the left subtree, you **continuously traverse to the leftmost child** starting from the root.
   - The idea is to get the height of the **deepest path** that starts from the root and only follows left children.
   - In a **perfect binary tree**, the leftmost path fully reaches the deepest level, which gives us the height of the tree.
   - **In a complete binary tree**: The height of the left subtree gives us an indication of how many nodes could potentially be in a perfectly balanced left subtree.

2. **Right Subtree Height (`right_height`)**:
   - When calculating the height of the right subtree, you **continuously traverse to the leftmost child** starting from the right child of the root.
   - In this case, you're checking how far you can go along the left side of the **right subtree**.
   - If the height of the right subtree is **equal** to the left subtree height, it means the last level of the tree is filled all the way to the right, implying that the entire left subtree is **perfect**.
   - If the **right height is less than the left height**, this means the right subtree does **not** reach as deep as the left subtree, indicating that the last level is only partially filled.

### Why Calculate Both Heights?

The heights of the left and right subtrees help to identify if a part of the tree is **perfect** or not. Specifically:

- If the **left height** equals the **right height**, then the entire tree (or subtree) is a **perfect binary tree**. You can calculate the number of nodes in a perfect tree using the formula \( 2^{\text{height}} - 1 \).

- If the **left height** is **greater** than the **right height**, it means the tree is not perfectly balanced. The right subtree is incomplete, and you need to count nodes in both the left and right subtrees recursively.

### Visualization:

Consider the following example:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   /
  4   5 6
```

- The left subtree of the root node (starting at `2`) has a left height of 2 (it includes `2 -> 4`).
- The right subtree of the root node (starting at `3`) has a left height of 2 (it includes `3 -> 6`).

Here, both the left and right subtrees have the same height. Therefore, the tree up to `6` is **complete**, and you can use the height to calculate the total number of nodes efficiently.

If the right subtree was smaller (e.g., if node `6` was missing), the left subtree would be **taller** than the right subtree. This imbalance indicates the need for further recursion to count nodes in the incomplete parts of the tree.

### Key Takeaway:
- The **left height** tells you how deep the leftmost path goes.
- The **right height** tells you how deep the rightmost complete part of the tree goes.
- By comparing them, you can efficiently count nodes by taking advantage of the tree's completeness structure.



To see how the code works when calculating the left and right subtree heights, let's break it down with a concrete example. We'll go step by step through the `compute_height` function, and observe how it calculates the left and right heights for a binary tree.

### The `compute_height` Function:

The `compute_height` function traverses the leftmost path of the tree (or subtree) to calculate the height. The height is simply the number of nodes encountered while traversing downwards to the left. For any subtree rooted at `node`, it returns the height of that subtree.

```python
def compute_height(node):
    height = 0
    while node:
        height += 1
        node = node.left  # Keep moving to the leftmost node
    return height
```

- It initializes `height = 0`.
- As long as the `node` is not `None`, it increments `height` and moves to the `node.left` (the next node down the leftmost path).

### Tree Example:

Consider this **complete binary tree**:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   /
  4   5 6
```

- **Root (`1`) has two children**: left child `2` and right child `3`.
- **Node `2`** has two children: left child `4` and right child `5`.
- **Node `3`** has one child: left child `6`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation for Left and Right Heights:

Let’s use the tree above and show how the code works for left and right subtree height calculation.

#### Step 1: Call the `compute_height` for Left Subtree of Root (Node `1`)

When we calculate the **left height** starting from the **left child** of the root (`2`):

- Start at node `2`, `height = 0`.
- Move to node `4` (the left child of `2`), increment `height` to `1`.
- Move to `None` (the left child of `4`), increment `height` to `2`.

So, `left_height = 2`.

#### Step 2: Call the `compute_height` for Right Subtree of Root (Node `1`)

When we calculate the **right height** starting from the **right child** of the root (`3`):

- Start at node `3`, `height = 0`.
- Move to node `6` (the left child of `3`), increment `height` to `1`.
- Move to `None` (the left child of `6`), increment `height` to `2`.

So, `right_height = 2`.

#### Step 3: Compare Left and Right Heights

After computing both `left_height` and `right_height`:
- `left_height = 2`
- `right_height = 2`

Since `left_height == right_height`, the tree (subtree starting at node `1`) is **perfect**, so we can use the formula to compute the number of nodes:

\[
\text{{Number of nodes}} = 2^{\text{{height}}} - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 3
\]

#### Another Example with Unbalanced Tree:

Consider a different tree where the left and right heights are not equal:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /
  4
```

- **Root (`1`) has two children**: left child `2` and right child `3`.
- **Node `2`** has one child: left child `4`.
- **Node `3`** has no children.

#### Step 1: Call the `compute_height` for Left Subtree of Root (Node `1`)

- Start at node `2`, `height = 0`.
- Move to node `4` (the left child of `2`), increment `height` to `1`.
- Move to `None` (the left child of `4`), increment `height` to `2`.

So, `left_height = 2`.

#### Step 2: Call the `compute_height` for Right Subtree of Root (Node `1`)

- Start at node `3`, `height = 0`.
- Move to `None` (the left child of `3`), increment `height` to `1`.

So, `right_height = 1`.

#### Step 3: Compare Left and Right Heights

After computing both `left_height` and `right_height`:
- `left_height = 2`
- `right_height = 1`

Since `left_height > right_height`, the left subtree is **not perfect**, so we need to recursively count the nodes in both left and right subtrees.

### Final Recap:

- The `compute_height` function calculates the height by always moving left, effectively counting the depth of the tree.
- Comparing the left and right subtree heights tells us whether the subtree is a perfect binary tree or not:
  - If `left_height == right_height`, the subtree is **perfect**, and we can directly compute the number of nodes.
  - If `left_height > right_height`, the subtree is **not perfect**, and we recursively count nodes in the left and right subtrees.


Let’s explore how the code behaves when a complete binary tree has **4 levels**. A full binary tree with 4 levels will have nodes in a structure similar to this:

```
           1
        /     \
      2         3
    /   \      /  \
   4     5    6    7
  / \   / \  / \  / \
 8   9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation for Left and Right Heights:

#### Step 1: Calculate the `left_height` for the Root (Node `1`):

Starting from the left child of the root, we traverse down the leftmost path.

1. Start at node `2`, `height = 0`.
2. Move to node `4` (left child of `2`), increment `height` to `1`.
3. Move to node `8` (left child of `4`), increment `height` to `2`.
4. Move to `None` (left child of `8`), increment `height` to `3`.

So, the **left height** is `3`.

#### Step 2: Calculate the `right_height` for the Root (Node `1`):

Starting from the right child of the root, we again traverse down the leftmost path.

1. Start at node `3`, `height = 0`.
2. Move to node `6` (left child of `3`), increment `height` to `1`.
3. Move to node `12` (left child of `6`), increment `height` to `2`.
4. Move to `None` (left child of `12`), increment `height` to `3`.

So, the **right height** is `3`.

#### Step 3: Compare Left and Right Heights:

- The left height is `3`.
- The right height is `3`.

Since `left_height == right_height`, the subtree is a **perfect binary tree**, meaning it is completely filled. The formula to calculate the number of nodes is:

\[
\text{{Number of nodes}} = 2^{\text{{height}}+1} - 1 = 2^{4} - 1 = 15
\]

This matches the number of nodes in the complete binary tree.

### Example with Unbalanced 4-Level Tree:

Now, consider an unbalanced 4-level tree:

```
           1
        /     \
      2         3
    /   \      /
   4     5    6
  / \   / \  /
 8   9 10 11 12
```

#### Step 1: Calculate `left_height` for the Root (Node `1`):

1. Start at node `2`, `height = 0`.
2. Move to node `4`, increment `height` to `1`.
3. Move to node `8`, increment `height` to `2`.
4. Move to `None`, increment `height` to `3`.

So, the **left height** is `3`.

#### Step 2: Calculate `right_height` for the Root (Node `1`):

1. Start at node `3`, `height = 0`.
2. Move to node `6`, increment `height` to `1`.
3. Move to node `12`, increment `height` to `2`.
4. Move to `None`, increment `height` to `3`.

So, the **right height** is `3`.

#### Step 3: Compare Left and Right Heights:

In this case:
- The left height is `3`.
- The right height is `2`.

Since `left_height > right_height`, the tree is **not perfect**, so we cannot use the formula. Instead, we need to recursively count the nodes in both the left and right subtrees:
- Count nodes in the left subtree rooted at `2`.
- Count nodes in the right subtree rooted at `3`.

Thus, the recursive approach kicks in, and the algorithm continues breaking down the tree into smaller parts to calculate the total number of nodes.

### Final Summary for a 4-Level Tree:

- If the tree is balanced (perfect), the formula \(2^{\text{{height}}+1} - 1\) can be used directly to compute the number of nodes.
- If the tree is unbalanced, the algorithm recursively counts the nodes by comparing the left and right subtree heights and deciding whether each subtree is perfect or needs further recursion.


Yes, the given tree is a **complete binary tree**.

A **complete binary tree** is defined as:
1. Every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled.
2. All nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

### Structure of the Given Tree:

```
           1
        /     \
      2         3
    /   \      /
   4     5    6
  / \   / \  /
 8   9 10 11 12
```

- **Level 1:** Node `1` is fully filled.
- **Level 2:** Nodes `2` and `3` are fully filled.
- **Level 3:** Nodes `4`, `5`, and `6` are fully filled (although node `6` has no right child, it doesn't violate the definition).
- **Level 4 (Last level):** Nodes `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, and `12` are filled from left to right with no gaps.

Since all levels are completely filled except for the last level, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible, **this tree is a complete binary tree**.

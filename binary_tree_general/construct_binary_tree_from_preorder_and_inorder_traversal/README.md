To construct a binary tree from its **preorder** and **inorder** traversals, we can use the following properties of these traversals:

1. **Preorder traversal** gives us the **root** of the tree first. For a subtree, the first element of the preorder traversal will always be the root of that subtree.
2. **Inorder traversal** helps us determine the **left** and **right subtrees** of a node. The elements to the left of the root in the inorder traversal belong to the left subtree, and the elements to the right of the root belong to the right subtree.

### Steps:
1. The first element of the preorder array is always the root of the current subtree.
2. Find that element in the inorder array. The elements to the left of this element in the inorder array will form the left subtree, and the elements to the right will form the right subtree.
3. Recursively apply the same logic to build the left and right subtrees.

### Algorithm:
- Use a helper function that recursively constructs the tree from subarrays of preorder and inorder arrays.
- Keep track of the current root node using the preorder array.
- Use a dictionary (hash map) to quickly locate the index of a node in the inorder array.

### Python Code:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def buildTree(preorder, inorder):
    # Dictionary to store the index of each value in the inorder list
    inorder_index_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(inorder)}

    # Helper function to recursively build the tree
    def buildSubTree(pre_left, pre_right, in_left, in_right):
        # Base case: if there are no elements to construct the subtree
        if pre_left > pre_right or in_left > in_right:
            return None

        # The first element of preorder is the root of the subtree
        root_val = preorder[pre_left]
        root = TreeNode(root_val)

        # Root's index in the inorder traversal
        inorder_root_index = inorder_index_map[root_val]

        # Number of elements in the left subtree
        left_subtree_size = inorder_root_index - in_left

        # Recursively build the left and right subtrees
        root.left = buildSubTree(pre_left + 1, pre_left + left_subtree_size, in_left, inorder_root_index - 1)
        root.right = buildSubTree(pre_left + left_subtree_size + 1, pre_right, inorder_root_index + 1, in_right)

        return root

    # Build the tree using the entire range of preorder and inorder arrays
    return buildSubTree(0, len(preorder) - 1, 0, len(inorder) - 1)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dictionary for Inorder Indexes**:
   - We use a dictionary (`inorder_index_map`) to store the index of each value in the `inorder` array, which allows for O(1) lookup time when determining the root's position in the inorder traversal.

2. **Recursive Subtree Construction**:
   - The helper function `buildSubTree` constructs the tree by dividing the `preorder` and `inorder` arrays into subarrays corresponding to the left and right subtrees.
   - It finds the root from the `preorder` array and determines the size of the left subtree using the root's index in the `inorder` array.
   - It recursively builds the left subtree and right subtree by adjusting the boundaries of the subarrays.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The recursion stops when the subarray boundaries are invalid (i.e., when `pre_left > pre_right` or `in_left > in_right`), meaning there are no nodes to form a subtree.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]`, `inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]`

  **Steps**:
  - `3` is the root (first element of `preorder`).
  - In `inorder`, the index of `3` is `1`. Elements to the left of `3` (`[9]`) form the left subtree, and elements to the right (`[15, 20, 7]`) form the right subtree.
  - Recursively repeat this process for each subtree.

  The constructed tree is:
  ```
      3
     / \
    9   20
        / \
       15  7
  ```

- Output: `[3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `preorder = [-1]`, `inorder = [-1]`
  - Since there's only one node, the tree is simply `[-1]`.
- Output: `[-1]`

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the recursion stack and the dictionary used to store the inorder indices.

This approach efficiently reconstructs the binary tree in linear time with the help of the dictionary.


Yes, the solution provided is optimal in terms of **time complexity** and **space complexity** for reconstructing a binary tree from preorder and inorder traversals.

### Key Points:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm processes each node exactly once while building the tree, so the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - The lookup in the `inorder_index_map` for each node's position in the inorder traversal is done in **O(1)** due to the hash map, which ensures that searching for indices in the inorder array is efficient.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is also **O(n)**. This is because:
     - The recursive call stack can go as deep as the height of the tree, which is **O(n)** in the worst case (e.g., if the tree is skewed).
     - The `inorder_index_map` stores the index of each node's value, requiring **O(n)** space.

3. **Optimality**:
   - **Time complexity of O(n)** is the best you can achieve because you need to process every node at least once.
   - **Space complexity of O(n)** is also necessary since we need to store the tree and handle recursion or iteration.

### Comparison with Alternative Approaches:
- **Iterative Solutions**: Although it’s possible to write an iterative solution, it wouldn’t offer better time or space complexity than the recursive solution. Additionally, recursive tree-building algorithms are often simpler and more intuitive for this problem, as recursion naturally mirrors the tree structure.

- **Alternative Data Structures**: You could explore alternative data structures, but for this specific problem of tree construction, a hash map (`inorder_index_map`) is already optimal for achieving O(1) lookup time.

### Conclusion:
The provided recursive solution using a hash map is the most efficient both in terms of time and space. There is no other solution that can improve upon the **O(n)** time complexity, and this approach is the best for handling the problem within the given constraints.


Let's break down the function `buildSubTree` step by step. This function is used to build a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversal arrays, which uniquely describe the structure of a tree.

### Key Terms:
- **Preorder Traversal**: Visits the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- **Inorder Traversal**: Visits the left subtree first, then the root, and finally the right subtree.

The function `buildSubTree` is called recursively to build left and right subtrees. The recursion is based on the relative position of the root node in both traversal arrays.

### Parameters:
- **`pre_left`** and **`pre_right`**: Indices of the current range in the preorder traversal array.
- **`in_left`** and **`in_right`**: Indices of the current range in the inorder traversal array.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Base Case:**
   ```python
   if pre_left > pre_right or in_left > in_right:
       return None
   ```
   - If there are no more elements in either the preorder or inorder traversal arrays, return `None`. This stops recursion when the left or right subtree has no nodes to build.

2. **Determine the Root Node:**
   ```python
   root_val = preorder[pre_left]
   root = TreeNode(root_val)
   ```
   - The first element of the current range in the preorder traversal (`preorder[pre_left]`) is the root of the current subtree. Create a `TreeNode` with that value as the root.

3. **Find the Root in the Inorder Array:**
   ```python
   inorder_root_index = inorder_index_map[root_val]
   ```
   - Look up the index of the root value in the inorder traversal array using a precomputed dictionary `inorder_index_map`. This index splits the inorder array into the left and right subtrees.

4. **Calculate the Size of the Left Subtree:**
   ```python
   left_subtree_size = inorder_root_index - in_left
   ```
   - The number of nodes in the left subtree is given by the difference between the root's index in the inorder array and the starting index of the current range (`in_left`).

5. **Recursively Build the Left Subtree:**
   ```python
   root.left = buildSubTree(pre_left + 1, pre_left + left_subtree_size, in_left, inorder_root_index - 1)
   ```
   - The left subtree is built by recursively calling `buildSubTree` on the next elements in the preorder array and the left portion of the inorder array:
     - Preorder range: The left subtree starts from the element immediately after the root (`pre_left + 1`) and spans `left_subtree_size` elements.
     - Inorder range: The left subtree consists of all elements before the root in the inorder array (`in_left` to `inorder_root_index - 1`).

6. **Recursively Build the Right Subtree:**
   ```python
   root.right = buildSubTree(pre_left + left_subtree_size + 1, pre_right, inorder_root_index + 1, in_right)
   ```
   - The right subtree is built similarly, but with the following ranges:
     - Preorder range: The right subtree starts immediately after the left subtree (`pre_left + left_subtree_size + 1`) and extends to the current range's end (`pre_right`).
     - Inorder range: The right subtree consists of all elements after the root in the inorder array (`inorder_root_index + 1` to `in_right`).

7. **Return the Root:**
   ```python
   return root
   ```
   - After building both the left and right subtrees, the root is returned, completing the construction of the current subtree.

### Example:

#### Preorder: `[3, 9, 20, 15, 7]`
#### Inorder:  `[9, 3, 15, 20, 7]`

1. The root is the first element in the preorder array: `3`.
2. In the inorder array, `3` splits the array into two parts:
   - Left subtree: `[9]`
   - Right subtree: `[15, 20, 7]`
3. Recursively build the left subtree:
   - Preorder: `[9]`
   - Inorder: `[9]`
   - Root is `9`, and there are no left or right children (base case).
4. Recursively build the right subtree:
   - Preorder: `[20, 15, 7]`
   - Inorder: `[15, 20, 7]`
   - Root is `20`, which splits the array into left subtree `[15]` and right subtree `[7]`.
5. Continue recursively for each subtree.

By following this process, the entire tree is reconstructed from its preorder and inorder traversals.

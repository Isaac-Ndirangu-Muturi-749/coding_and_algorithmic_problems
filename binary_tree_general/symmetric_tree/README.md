To check if a binary tree is symmetric, we need to determine whether the left subtree is a mirror of the right subtree. This can be done both **recursively** and **iteratively**.

### Recursive Solution:

In a recursive approach, we compare the left and right subtrees to see if:
1. The values of the left and right nodes are the same.
2. The left child of the left subtree is a mirror of the right child of the right subtree.
3. The right child of the left subtree is a mirror of the left child of the right subtree.

#### Recursive Code Implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSymmetric(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    # Helper function to check if two trees are mirror images
    def isMirror(left: TreeNode, right: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not left and not right:
            return True
        if not left or not right:
            return False
        return (left.val == right.val and
                isMirror(left.left, right.right) and
                isMirror(left.right, right.left))

    if not root:
        return True
    return isMirror(root.left, root.right)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If both the left and right nodes are `None`, the tree is symmetric.
2. **Mismatch Case**: If one of the nodes is `None` and the other isn't, the tree is not symmetric.
3. **Recursive Case**: Check if the left and right subtree nodes have the same value, and then recursively compare the left child of the left subtree with the right child of the right subtree and vice versa.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We visit every node in the tree once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(h)**: Due to the recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this is `O(n)` for a skewed tree.

---

### Iterative Solution:

In an iterative approach, we can use a **queue** (or stack) to perform a level-by-level comparison of nodes from the left and right subtrees. We push pairs of nodes onto the queue, representing nodes that should be symmetric.

#### Iterative Code Implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

def isSymmetric(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if not root:
        return True

    # Initialize a queue to store node pairs
    queue = deque([(root.left, root.right)])

    while queue:
        left, right = queue.popleft()

        # Both are None, continue with other pairs
        if not left and not right:
            continue

        # If only one is None or the values don't match, the tree is not symmetric
        if not left or not right or left.val != right.val:
            return False

        # Enqueue the symmetric nodes for further comparison
        queue.append((left.left, right.right))
        queue.append((left.right, right.left))

    return True
```

### Explanation:

1. We initialize a queue with the root's left and right children.
2. We process each pair of nodes by checking:
   - If both nodes are `None`, we continue.
   - If one is `None` or their values don't match, return `False`.
   - Otherwise, we push the corresponding children to the queue: left-left with right-right and left-right with right-left.
3. The loop continues until the queue is empty. If no asymmetries are found, the tree is symmetric.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: Each node is processed once.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, the queue can hold up to `n/2` nodes.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`

```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \ / \
   3  4 4  3
```

- Recursive: Compare the left and right subtrees:
  - `2 == 2`
  - Compare `3 == 3` and `4 == 4`
  - The tree is symmetric.

- Iterative: Enqueue `(2, 2)`, then `(3, 3)` and `(4, 4)`. All pairs match, so the tree is symmetric.

#### Example 2:
Input: `root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`

```
       1
      / \
     2   2
      \    \
      3     3
```

- Recursive: Compare the left and right subtrees:
  - `2 == 2`
  - Left subtree has `None`, right subtree has `3`, so the tree is not symmetric.

- Iterative: Enqueue `(2, 2)`, then `(None, 3)` and `(3, None)`. Mismatch found, so the tree is not symmetric.

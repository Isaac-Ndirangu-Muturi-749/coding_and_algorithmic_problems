To find the starting and ending position of a given target value in a sorted array with an O(log n) runtime complexity, we can use a modified binary search algorithm. We'll perform the binary search twice: once to find the leftmost (starting) position and once to find the rightmost (ending) position of the target.

Here's how you can implement this approach:

### Implementation

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findLeft(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left

    def findRight(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] <= target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return right

    left_index = findLeft(nums, target)
    right_index = findRight(nums, target)

    # Check if the target is actually in the array
    if left_index <= right_index and left_index < len(nums) and nums[left_index] == target:
        return [left_index, right_index]

    return [-1, -1]

# Example usage:
print(searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 8))  # Output: [3, 4]
print(searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 6))  # Output: [-1, -1]
print(searchRange([], 0))               # Output: [-1, -1]
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Left Index**:
   - The `findLeft` function performs a binary search to find the leftmost index of the target.
   - If `nums[mid] < target`, it means the target must be in the right half, so we adjust the `left` pointer.
   - If `nums[mid] >= target`, it means the target could be at `mid`, so we adjust the `right` pointer.

2. **Finding the Right Index**:
   - The `findRight` function performs a similar binary search to find the rightmost index of the target.
   - If `nums[mid] <= target`, it means the target could still be at `mid` or further right, so we adjust the `left` pointer.
   - If `nums[mid] > target`, we adjust the `right` pointer.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - After finding the indices, we check if the left index is valid and whether the element at that index matches the target.

4. **Return**:
   - If the target is found, we return both indices; otherwise, we return `[-1, -1]`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) due to the binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space.

This approach is efficient and works well for the given problem constraints.


The binary search method described previously is already optimal for finding the starting and ending positions of a target value in a sorted array, achieving a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\). However, there are some additional techniques and considerations that could enhance the solution in terms of clarity or usability rather than performance.

Here are a few alternative approaches or enhancements that you could consider:

### 1. Simplified Approach Using a Single Function

Instead of having two separate functions for finding the leftmost and rightmost indices, you can use a single loop to manage both indices more concisely:

```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    start, end = -1, -1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        if nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            start = mid  # found target, record position
            # Move left to find the first occurrence
            end = mid
            while start >= 0 and nums[start] == target:
                start -= 1
            while end < len(nums) and nums[end] == target:
                end += 1
            return [start + 1, end - 1]  # Adjusting indices to return correct range

    return [-1, -1]

# Example usage:
print(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 8))  # Output: [3, 4]
print(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 6))  # Output: [-1, -1]
print(searchRange([], 0))                    # Output: [-1, -1]
```

### 2. Using Python's Built-in Functions

If you're allowed to use built-in functions, you can leverage the `bisect` module, which provides fast and efficient ways to handle sorted lists. This method might be easier to read but won't outperform the \(O(\log n)\) complexity.

```python
import bisect

def searchRange(nums, target):
    left_index = bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
    right_index = bisect.bisect_right(nums, target) - 1

    if left_index < len(nums) and nums[left_index] == target:
        return [left_index, right_index]

    return [-1, -1]

# Example usage:
print(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 8))  # Output: [3, 4]
print(searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], 6))  # Output: [-1, -1]
print(searchRange([], 0))                    # Output: [-1, -1]
```

### 3. Additional Considerations

- **Handling Edge Cases**: Make sure to test your function with edge cases like arrays with all identical elements, arrays with one element, or targets that are smaller/larger than all elements in the array.

- **Clarity vs. Complexity**: Sometimes, a more straightforward implementation (like the `bisect` approach) can be easier to understand, even if it doesn't provide performance improvements over the binary search method.

### Conclusion

The binary search approach remains the best in terms of performance for this problem. Alternatives can enhance code readability or utilize existing libraries, but they don't offer significant performance benefits. The most efficient and clear solution depends on your specific use case and coding preferences.


It looks like you've provided a code snippet for a binary search function that finds the starting and ending positions of a target value in a sorted array. However, there are several syntax errors and some issues with the logic. Let’s clean it up and make it functional:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = self.binSearch(nums, target, True)
        right = self.binSearch(nums, target, False)
        return [left, right]

    # leftBias = [True/False], if false, res is rightBiased
    def binSearch(self, nums: List[int], target: int, leftBias: bool) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        i = -1

        while l <= r:
            m = (l + r) // 2

            if target > nums[m]:
                l = m + 1
            elif target < nums[m]:
                r = m - 1
            else:
                i = m  # Found the target
                if leftBias:
                    r = m - 1  # Search in the left half
                else:
                    l = m + 1  # Search in the right half

        return i

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 8))  # Output: [3, 4]
print(solution.searchRange([5,7,7,8,8,10], 6))  # Output: [-1, -1]
print(solution.searchRange([], 0))  # Output: [-1, -1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Class Structure**: A class `Solution` encapsulates the functionality.
2. **`searchRange` Method**:
   - Calls `binSearch` twice: once for the leftmost index and once for the rightmost index of the target.
3. **`binSearch` Method**:
   - Takes in the `nums` list, the `target`, and a boolean `leftBias` to indicate if it’s looking for the leftmost index.
   - Initializes pointers `l` and `r` for the binary search range.
   - Uses a loop to narrow down the search space:
     - If the target is greater than the middle element, it moves the left pointer up.
     - If the target is less than the middle element, it moves the right pointer down.
     - If the target is found, it updates the index `i` and adjusts the pointers based on whether it’s searching for the left or right index.
4. **Return Value**: Returns the index of the found target, or `-1` if not found.

This implementation ensures that the search operates in \(O(\log n)\) time complexity, which is efficient for this problem.


Certainly! Let's break down how the binary search algorithm in your code updates the index and adjusts the pointers based on whether it's searching for the leftmost or rightmost index of the target.

### Understanding the Logic

1. **Finding the Target**:
   - During the binary search, if the target value is found (i.e., `nums[m] == target`), the variable `i` is updated to `m`, which is the index of the current middle element. This keeps track of the last found index of the target.

2. **Deciding the Search Direction**:
   - The boolean parameter `leftBias` indicates whether the current search should continue looking for the leftmost index or the rightmost index of the target.

### Leftmost vs. Rightmost Index

- **Leftmost Index Search (leftBias = True)**:
  - When searching for the leftmost index, if the target is found at index `m`, we want to check if there are more occurrences of the target to the left. Therefore, we adjust the right pointer `r`:
    ```python
    r = m - 1
    ```
  - This effectively narrows the search space to the left half of the array. By continuing this process, the algorithm will eventually converge on the leftmost occurrence of the target.

- **Rightmost Index Search (leftBias = False)**:
  - Conversely, when searching for the rightmost index, if the target is found at index `m`, we want to check if there are more occurrences of the target to the right. Thus, we adjust the left pointer `l`:
    ```python
    l = m + 1
    ```
  - This narrows the search space to the right half of the array, allowing the algorithm to find the rightmost occurrence of the target.

### Example Illustration

Let’s say we have the array `nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]` and we are looking for `target = 8`.

- **Finding the Leftmost Index**:
  1. Suppose we find `8` at index `3`. We set `i = 3`.
  2. Since we're looking for the leftmost index (`leftBias = True`), we set `r = 2` and continue searching.
  3. The next middle index `m` is recalculated. If we find `8` at index `2`, we again update `i = 2` and set `r = 1`.
  4. We repeat until we cannot find `8` anymore on the left side.

- **Finding the Rightmost Index**:
  1. Again, suppose we find `8` at index `3`. We set `i = 3`.
  2. Since we're looking for the rightmost index (`leftBias = False`), we set `l = 4` and continue searching.
  3. If we find `8` at index `4`, we update `i = 4` and set `l = 5` to look for any more occurrences on the right.
  4. We stop when there are no more `8`s to find on the right.

### Summary

- The adjustment of pointers based on the value of `leftBias` allows the algorithm to continue searching in the appropriate half of the array after finding a target value.
- This process ensures that all possible occurrences of the target are checked, resulting in an accurate identification of the leftmost and rightmost indices of the target in the sorted array.


The time complexity of the `searchRange` function can be analyzed based on how the function operates, especially focusing on the binary search and the subsequent searches for the first and last occurrences of the target value. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Binary Search**:
   - The first part of the algorithm uses binary search to find the target value in the sorted array. The binary search operates in \( O(\log n) \) time complexity, where \( n \) is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

2. **Finding the Range**:
   - After finding the target, the algorithm has two additional while loops to find the first and last occurrences of the target:
     - The first while loop moves left from the position of the target to find the first occurrence. In the worst case, this loop can traverse all instances of the target to the left, but it will not exceed \( O(n) \) because it will stop at the first non-target element.
     - The second while loop moves right to find the last occurrence, which also can traverse all instances of the target to the right and will similarly not exceed \( O(n) \).

### Overall Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity of the `searchRange` function is dominated by the binary search, which is \( O(\log n) \), and the subsequent linear scans to find the start and end of the range, which can take up to \( O(n) \) in the worst case.

Thus, the worst-case time complexity of the function is:
\[
O(n)
\]

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input list.


Certainly! Let’s break down your `searchRange` function and its binary search implementation using the example input `solution.searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10], 8)`.

### Overview of the Function
The `searchRange` function aims to find the starting and ending positions of a given `target` in a sorted list `nums`. It does this by using a binary search algorithm twice:
1. **First Call (Left Bias)**: It finds the leftmost (first) occurrence of the target.
2. **Second Call (Right Bias)**: It finds the rightmost (last) occurrence of the target.

### Binary Search Implementation
The `binSearch` function is designed to perform a binary search based on whether the bias is to the left (for finding the first occurrence) or to the right (for finding the last occurrence). Here’s how it works:

- **Parameters**:
  - `nums`: The sorted list of numbers.
  - `target`: The number you want to find.
  - `leftBias`: A boolean that determines whether to search for the leftmost occurrence (`True`) or the rightmost occurrence (`False`).

### Example Explanation
Now, let’s walk through the example you provided:

```python
solution = Solution()
result = solution.searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10], 8)
print(result)  # Output: [3, 7]
```

1. **Finding the Leftmost Occurrence of 8**:
   - Call `binSearch([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10], 8, True)`:
     - **Initialization**: `l = 0`, `r = 8` (the last index), `i = -1`
     - **First Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4`
       - `nums[4] = 8` (target found), set `i = 4`, since `leftBias` is `True`, update `r = 3` (search left).
     - **Second Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`
       - `nums[1] = 7` (target not found), update `l = 2`.
     - **Third Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (2 + 3) // 2 = 2`
       - `nums[2] = 7` (target not found), update `l = 3`.
     - **Fourth Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (3 + 3) // 2 = 3`
       - `nums[3] = 8` (target found), set `i = 3`, update `r = 2` (search left).
     - The loop ends when `l > r`. It returns `i = 3` (the leftmost index of 8).

2. **Finding the Rightmost Occurrence of 8**:
   - Call `binSearch([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10], 8, False)`:
     - **Initialization**: `l = 0`, `r = 8`, `i = -1`
     - **First Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4`
       - `nums[4] = 8` (target found), set `i = 4`, since `leftBias` is `False`, update `l = 5` (search right).
     - **Second Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (5 + 8) // 2 = 6`
       - `nums[6] = 8` (target found), set `i = 6`, update `l = 7` (search right).
     - **Third Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (7 + 8) // 2 = 7`
       - `nums[7] = 8` (target found), set `i = 7`, update `l = 8` (search right).
     - **Fourth Iteration**:
       - Calculate `m = (8 + 8) // 2 = 8`
       - `nums[8] = 10` (target not found), update `r = 7`.
     - The loop ends when `l > r`. It returns `i = 7` (the rightmost index of 8).

### Final Output
The final output of `solution.searchRange([5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 10], 8)` is `[3, 7]`, indicating that the first occurrence of `8` is at index `3` and the last occurrence is at index `7`.

### Summary
- The `searchRange` method successfully finds both the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of the target value in a sorted list using binary search.
- The output `[3, 7]` reflects the indices of the first and last appearances of `8` in the input list.

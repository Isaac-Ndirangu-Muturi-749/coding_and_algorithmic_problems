To solve this problem, we can use **Binary Search** to efficiently find the minimum eating speed \( k \) that allows Koko to finish all bananas within \( h \) hours. Here's the step-by-step explanation and solution:

---

### Approach:
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - Koko eats \( k \) bananas per hour.
   - For each pile, the time taken to eat that pile is \(\lceil \text{pile[i]} / k \rceil\).
   - The goal is to minimize \( k \) such that the total time across all piles is \(\leq h\).

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The minimum possible \( k \) is 1 (slowest speed).
   - The maximum possible \( k \) is \(\max(\text{piles})\) (eating all bananas in one hour for the largest pile).
   - Use binary search to find the smallest \( k \) that satisfies the condition.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - Write a helper function to determine if a given \( k \) can allow Koko to finish all bananas within \( h \) hours.
   - For each pile, compute the time needed as \(\lceil \text{pile[i]} / k \rceil\), which is equivalent to \((\text{pile[i]} + k - 1) // k\) in integer math.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Start with \( \text{left} = 1 \) and \( \text{right} = \max(\text{piles}) \).
   - For each midpoint \( k = (\text{left} + \text{right}) // 2 \), check if \( k \) is feasible:
     - If \( k \) is feasible, reduce \( \text{right} \) to \( k \).
     - If \( k \) is not feasible, increase \( \text{left} \) to \( k + 1 \).
   - Continue until \( \text{left} == \text{right} \), which is the minimum \( k \).

### Implementation (Python):

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: list[int], h: int) -> int:
        # Helper function to check if Koko can finish with speed k
        def canFinish(k):
            total_hours = 0
            for pile in piles:
                total_hours += (pile + k - 1) // k  # Equivalent to ceil(pile / k)
            return total_hours <= h

        # Binary search for the minimum k
        left, right = 1, max(piles)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if canFinish(mid):
                right = mid  # Try smaller speeds
            else:
                left = mid + 1  # Increase speed
        return left
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
```
- Binary search range: [1, 11].
- Midpoint \( k = 6 \), check feasibility:
  - Time = \(\lceil 3/6 \rceil + \lceil 6/6 \rceil + \lceil 7/6 \rceil + \lceil 11/6 \rceil = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6\) hours.
  - \( k = 6 \) is feasible, reduce search range to [1, 6].
- Continue searching, result is \( k = 4 \).

#### Example 2:
```python
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
```
- Binary search range: [1, 30].
- Midpoint \( k = 15 \), check feasibility:
  - Time = \(\lceil 30/15 \rceil + \lceil 11/15 \rceil + \lceil 23/15 \rceil + \lceil 4/15 \rceil + \lceil 20/15 \rceil = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8\) hours.
  - \( k = 15 \) is not feasible, increase range to [16, 30].
- Continue searching, result is \( k = 30 \).

#### Example 3:
```python
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
```
- Binary search range: [1, 30].
- Midpoint \( k = 15 \), check feasibility:
  - Time = 8 hours (\( k = 15 \) not feasible).
  - Increase range to [16, 30].
- Continue searching, result is \( k = 23 \).

### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - \( O(n \cdot \log(\max(\text{piles}))) \): Binary search over \( \max(\text{piles}) \), and for each \( k \), we iterate through all piles to check feasibility.
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - \( O(1) \): Constant extra space.

```python
Solution().minEatingSpeed([3,6,7,11], 8)  # Output: 4
Solution().minEatingSpeed([30,11,23,4,20], 5)  # Output: 30
Solution().minEatingSpeed([30,11,23,4,20], 6)  # Output: 23
```

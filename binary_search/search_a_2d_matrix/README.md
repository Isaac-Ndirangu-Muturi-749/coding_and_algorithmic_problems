To solve the problem of finding a target value in a 2D matrix where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row, you can treat the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array. This allows the use of binary search to achieve the desired time complexity of \(O(\log(m \times n))\).

### Approach:
1. **Matrix Properties**: Given that the matrix has rows and columns sorted in a specific way, you can map any index in the matrix to an index in a virtual 1D array.
2. **Binary Search**: You can apply binary search across the entire matrix by converting 2D indices to 1D and vice versa. This allows us to treat the matrix as a sorted array and search efficiently.

### Steps:
- Use binary search to find the target.
- Convert midpoints in the binary search from 1D index to a 2D matrix index using the following conversions:
  - Row index: `mid // n`
  - Column index: `mid % n`
- Compare the target with the middle element, and adjust the search range accordingly.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: [[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return False

        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        left, right = 0, m * n - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            mid_value = matrix[mid // n][mid % n]

            if mid_value == target:
                return True
            elif mid_value < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        return False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matrix Size**: `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
2. **Binary Search**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to perform binary search across the virtual 1D array of size `m * n`.
3. **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is calculated, and the corresponding value in the matrix is accessed using `matrix[mid // n][mid % n]` to convert the 1D index back to 2D.
4. **Comparison**:
   - If the `mid_value` is equal to the target, return `True`.
   - If the `mid_value` is less than the target, adjust the search range to the right.
   - If the `mid_value` is greater than the target, adjust the search range to the left.
5. **Return**: If the search completes without finding the target, return `False`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is \(O(\log(m \times n))\), as required. This is the result of binary search on an array of size \(m \times n\).

### Example 1:
```python
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]
target = 3
solution = Solution()
print(solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target))  # Output: True
```

### Example 2:
```python
matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]
target = 13
solution = Solution()
print(solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target))  # Output: False
```

### Edge Cases:
- Empty matrix.
- Single element matrix.
- Target is smaller or larger than any element in the matrix.

The line of code:

```python
if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
    return False
```

is used to handle edge cases for a matrix input. Hereâ€™s what it does:

### Breakdown:

1. **Check if the Matrix is Empty**:
   ```python
   if not matrix
   ```
   - This condition checks if `matrix` is an empty list (`[]`).
   - If `matrix` is empty, it means there are no rows in the matrix, so the function returns `False`.

2. **Check if the First Row is Empty**:
   ```python
   if not matrix[0]
   ```
   - This condition checks if the first row of the matrix is an empty list (`[]`).
   - If the first row is empty, it means that the matrix has rows, but none of them contain elements, so the function returns `False`.

### Why These Checks Are Important:

- **Empty Matrix**: If `matrix` is empty, it has no rows, so any operations assuming the presence of rows or columns would be invalid.

- **Empty First Row**: If the matrix has rows but the first row is empty, it implies that the entire matrix is empty (i.e., it has no columns). This also makes further operations on the matrix invalid.

### Usage:

This type of check is commonly used in functions that need to operate on a 2D matrix to ensure that the input matrix is valid and has the expected structure (i.e., it is not empty and contains rows with columns).

### Example:

For a function that performs operations on a matrix, this check ensures that the matrix is valid before proceeding:

```python
def some_function(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False

    # Continue with operations on a valid matrix
    # ...
```

- **Input:** `matrix = []`
  - **Output:** `False` (since the matrix is empty)

- **Input:** `matrix = [[]]`
  - **Output:** `False` (since the first row is empty)

- **Input:** `matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
  - **Output:** Proceed with matrix operations (valid matrix)

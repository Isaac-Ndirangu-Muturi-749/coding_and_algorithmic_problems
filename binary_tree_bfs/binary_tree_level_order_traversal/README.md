The **level order traversal** of a binary tree processes the nodes level by level, from top to bottom, left to right. This approach is commonly done using a queue to ensure nodes are processed in the correct order.

As Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, "Patience, young one." This method, like traversing the levels of a tree, requires steady and systematic progress.

### Approach:
1. We can use a **queue** to keep track of the nodes at each level.
2. For each node, process its left and right children and add them to the queue.
3. Once all nodes at the current level are processed, move on to the next.

### Code Implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def levelOrder(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []

    result = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level = []
        for i in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        result.append(level)

    return result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Case**: If the tree is empty, return an empty list.
2. **Queue Initialization**: We use a queue to store nodes level by level.
3. **Level Processing**: For each node in the current level, we add its children to the queue and collect its value.
4. **Result Collection**: Once all nodes of a level are processed, store the level's values and continue.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`
```
       3
      / \
     9   20
        /  \
       15   7
```
- Level 1: `[3]`
- Level 2: `[9, 20]`
- Level 3: `[15, 7]`
Output: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `root = [1]`
- Level 1: `[1]`
Output: `[[1]]`

#### Example 3:
Input: `root = []`
- Empty tree, so the output is `[]`.

This method ensures that each node is processed just once, making it an efficient and simple solution to implement.

This problem involves determining the minimum number of bit flips required to make the bitwise `OR` of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) equal to a third integer \(c\). Let's break it down.

---

### Key Observations:
1. **Bitwise `OR`**:
   - A bit in \(a \lor b\) is `1` if either the corresponding bit in \(a\), \(b\), or both is `1`.
   - A bit in \(a \lor b\) is `0` if the corresponding bits in both \(a\) and \(b\) are `0`.

2. **Conditions for Flips**:
   - If a bit in \(c\) is `1` but both corresponding bits in \(a\) and \(b\) are `0`, we need **1 flip** to make one of them `1`.
   - If a bit in \(c\) is `0` but a corresponding bit in \(a\) or \(b\) is `1`, we need to flip each of those bits to `0`. This could require **1 or 2 flips**.

3. **Iterative Solution**:
   - Iterate through each bit of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
   - Compare the bits and determine how many flips are needed.

---

### Algorithm:
1. Use bit manipulation to examine each bit of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
2. Count the number of flips required for each bit based on the conditions above.
3. Stop when all bits of \(c\) have been processed (because the problem doesn't depend on bits beyond the highest set bit in \(c\)).

---

### Implementation (Python):
```python
def minFlips(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    flips = 0
    while a > 0 or b > 0 or c > 0:
        # Extract the least significant bits
        bit_a = a & 1
        bit_b = b & 1
        bit_c = c & 1

        if bit_c == 0:
            # If c's bit is 0, both a and b's bits must be 0
            flips += bit_a + bit_b
        else:
            # If c's bit is 1, at least one of a or b's bits must be 1
            if bit_a == 0 and bit_b == 0:
                flips += 1

        # Shift all numbers to the right to check the next bit
        a >>= 1
        b >>= 1
        c >>= 1

    return flips
```

### Example Walkthrough:
#### Example 1:
Input: \(a = 2\), \(b = 6\), \(c = 5\)
- Binary:
  - \(a = 010\)
  - \(b = 110\)
  - \(c = 101\)
- Process:
  - Compare bit by bit:
    1. \(a[0] = 0\), \(b[0] = 0\), \(c[0] = 1\) → Flip 1 bit (make one of \(a[0]\) or \(b[0]\) 1).
    2. \(a[1] = 1\), \(b[1] = 1\), \(c[1] = 0\) → Flip 2 bits (make both \(a[1]\) and \(b[1]\) 0).
    3. \(a[2] = 0\), \(b[2] = 1\), \(c[2] = 1\) → No flip needed.
- Total Flips: \(3\).

Output: \(3\)

#### Example 2:
Input: \(a = 4\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 7\)
- Binary:
  - \(a = 100\)
  - \(b = 010\)
  - \(c = 111\)
- Process:
  - Compare bit by bit:
    1. \(a[0] = 0\), \(b[0] = 0\), \(c[0] = 1\) → Flip 1 bit.
    2. \(a[1] = 0\), \(b[1] = 1\), \(c[1] = 1\) → No flip needed.
    3. \(a[2] = 1\), \(b[2] = 0\), \(c[2] = 1\) → No flip needed.
- Total Flips: \(1\).

Output: \(1\)

#### Example 3:
Input: \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\)
- Binary:
  - \(a = 001\)
  - \(b = 010\)
  - \(c = 011\)
- Process:
  - Compare bit by bit:
    1. \(a[0] = 1\), \(b[0] = 0\), \(c[0] = 1\) → No flip needed.
    2. \(a[1] = 0\), \(b[1] = 1\), \(c[1] = 1\) → No flip needed.
    3. \(a[2] = 0\), \(b[2] = 0\), \(c[2] = 0\) → No flip needed.
- Total Flips: \(0\).

Output: \(0\).

### Complexity Analysis:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The loop runs for at most 32 iterations (for 32-bit integers).
   - Each iteration involves constant time operations.
   - **O(1)** for each bit, so the overall complexity is **O(32) = O(1)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Constant space is used.
   - **O(1)**.

### Output for Given Examples:
```python
print(minFlips(2, 6, 5))  # Output: 3
print(minFlips(4, 2, 7))  # Output: 1
print(minFlips(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 0
```

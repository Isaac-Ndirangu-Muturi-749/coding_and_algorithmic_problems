To solve the problem, we can implement the **RecentCounter** class using a **queue**. The main idea is to keep track of only the timestamps of requests that fall within the range \([t - 3000, t]\). Each time we add a new request, we remove any timestamps that are no longer in the valid range.

Here's the detailed implementation:

---

### **Algorithm**
1. Use a queue to store the timestamps of the requests.
2. When a new request is added (via the `ping` method):
   - Add the new timestamp to the queue.
   - Remove timestamps from the front of the queue that are less than \( t - 3000 \), as they are outside the valid range.
3. The size of the queue after removing invalid timestamps represents the number of valid requests in the range \([t - 3000, t]\).
4. Return the size of the queue.

---

### **Code Implementation**

```python
from collections import deque

class RecentCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty queue
        self.requests = deque()

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        # Add the new request timestamp to the queue
        self.requests.append(t)

        # Remove timestamps outside the valid range
        while self.requests[0] < t - 3000:
            self.requests.popleft()

        # The size of the queue is the number of valid requests
        return len(self.requests)
```

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each request is added and removed from the queue exactly once.
   - For \( n \) requests, the total work done is \( O(n) \).
   - Thus, the average time complexity per `ping` call is \( O(1) \).
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The maximum size of the queue is proportional to the number of requests in the last 3000 milliseconds. In the worst case, all requests could fall in the valid range.
   - Space complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the maximum number of requests in the valid range.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### Input:
```plaintext
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```plaintext
   recentCounter = RecentCounter()
   requests = []
   ```

2. **Ping 1**:
   - Add `1` to the queue.
   - Range: \([-2999, 1]\). All timestamps are valid.
   - Queue: \([1]\).
   - Return: `1`.

3. **Ping 100**:
   - Add `100` to the queue.
   - Range: \([-2900, 100]\). All timestamps are valid.
   - Queue: \([1, 100]\).
   - Return: `2`.

4. **Ping 3001**:
   - Add `3001` to the queue.
   - Range: \([1, 3001]\). All timestamps are valid.
   - Queue: \([1, 100, 3001]\).
   - Return: `3`.

5. **Ping 3002**:
   - Add `3002` to the queue.
   - Range: \([2, 3002]\). Remove `1` from the queue.
   - Queue: \([100, 3001, 3002]\).
   - Return: `3`.

#### Output:
```plaintext
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]
```

### **Why Use a Queue?**
A queue is ideal for this problem because:
- **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** behavior aligns with removing outdated timestamps as new ones arrive.
- Efficient operations: appending to the queue and removing elements from the front both run in \( O(1) \) time.

---

### **Constraints**
- \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^9 \): The input range of \( t \) does not affect the algorithm since the queue size depends only on the number of requests within the past 3000 milliseconds, not the absolute value of \( t \).
- At most \( 10^4 \) calls: The implementation is efficient enough to handle this.

---

This solution is optimal and meets all problem constraints efficiently.

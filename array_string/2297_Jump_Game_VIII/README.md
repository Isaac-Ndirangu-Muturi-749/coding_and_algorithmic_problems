### **Solution Approach:**
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to reach the last index (`n-1`) from index `0` while following specific jump rules. Since we need the shortest path with weighted edges (costs), **Dijkstra's algorithm (or a priority queue-based approach)** is well-suited for this problem.

---

### **Key Observations:**
1. We can only jump **forward** (`i < j`).
2. A valid jump `(i â†’ j)` occurs if:
   - **Increasing case:** `nums[i] <= nums[j]` and every number between them (`nums[k]` for `i < k < j`) is **strictly smaller** than `nums[i]`.
   - **Decreasing case:** `nums[i] > nums[j]` and every number between them is **greater than or equal** to `nums[i]`.
3. The goal is to **find the minimum-cost path** from `0` to `n-1`.

---

### **Efficient Approach using a Priority Queue (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**
- **Graph Representation:**
  - Treat `nums` as nodes and valid jumps as directed weighted edges with `costs[j]` as the edge weight.
- **Priority Queue (`min-heap`) to find the minimum-cost path:**
  - The priority queue stores `(current_cost, index)`, and we always expand the **minimum-cost** option first.
- **Processing:**
  1. Start at `index 0` with cost `0`.
  2. Try jumping to all valid `j > i` and update the cost if it's lower than the previously found cost.
  3. Use a **priority queue (heap)** to always process the node with the **lowest current cost** first.
  4. If we reach `index n-1`, return the cost.

### **Implementation:**
```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_cost = [float('inf')] * n  # Store min cost to reach each index
        min_cost[0] = 0  # Cost to reach index 0 is 0
        pq = [(0, 0)]  # (current cost, index)

        # Maintain two monotonic stacks to find valid jumps efficiently
        increasing_stack = deque()  # Monotonic increasing
        decreasing_stack = deque()  # Monotonic decreasing

        while pq:
            current_cost, i = heappop(pq)

            if i == n - 1:
                return current_cost  # Found the minimum cost to reach the last index

            # Process increasing valid jumps
            while increasing_stack and nums[increasing_stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
                j = increasing_stack.pop()
                new_cost = current_cost + costs[j]
                if new_cost < min_cost[j]:
                    min_cost[j] = new_cost
                    heappush(pq, (new_cost, j))

            increasing_stack.append(i)

            # Process decreasing valid jumps
            while decreasing_stack and nums[decreasing_stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
                j = decreasing_stack.pop()
                new_cost = current_cost + costs[j]
                if new_cost < min_cost[j]:
                    min_cost[j] = new_cost
                    heappush(pq, (new_cost, j))

            decreasing_stack.append(i)

        return -1  # Should never reach here if there's always a valid path
```

### **Complexity Analysis:**
- **Heap operations (`O(log n)`)**: Each node is pushed/popped at most once, leading to `O(n log n)`.
- **Monotonic Stack Processing (`O(n)`)**: Each element is processed at most once in the stacks.
- **Total Complexity:** **`O(n log n)`** (Dijkstraâ€™s with monotonic stacks).

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1:**
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [3,2,4,4,1], costs = [3,7,6,4,2]
```
**Valid jumps:**
- `0 â†’ 2` (`3 â†’ 4` with cost `6`)
- `2 â†’ 4` (`4 â†’ 1` with cost `2`)

**Output:**
```plaintext
8
```

---

### **Why This Works Efficiently**
- **Avoids checking all `O(n^2)` pairs** by using **monotonic stacks**.
- **Uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to ensure we **always expand the lowest-cost path first**.
- **Ensures `O(n log n)` complexity** instead of brute-force `O(n^2)`.

This approach guarantees the **minimum cost** while efficiently processing valid jumps. ðŸš€



### **Refactored Code with Improved Variable Naming**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minCost(self, nums: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        adjacency_list = defaultdict(list)  # Stores valid jumps from each index
        increasing_stack = []  # Monotonic increasing stack
        decreasing_stack = []  # Monotonic decreasing stack

        # Build the graph for valid jumps based on increasing sequence rule
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while increasing_stack and nums[increasing_stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
                increasing_stack.pop()
            if increasing_stack:
                adjacency_list[i].append(increasing_stack[-1])
            increasing_stack.append(i)

        # Build the graph for valid jumps based on decreasing sequence rule
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while decreasing_stack and nums[decreasing_stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
                decreasing_stack.pop()
            if decreasing_stack:
                adjacency_list[i].append(decreasing_stack[-1])
            decreasing_stack.append(i)

        # Dynamic Programming array to track minimum cost to reach each index
        min_cost = [float('inf')] * n
        min_cost[0] = 0  # Starting point has 0 cost

        # Traverse and update costs using DP
        for i in range(n):
            for next_index in adjacency_list[i]:
                min_cost[next_index] = min(min_cost[next_index], min_cost[i] + costs[next_index])

        return min_cost[n - 1]  # Minimum cost to reach last index
```

### **Approach & Explanation**
This solution uses **monotonic stacks** and **dynamic programming (DP)** to efficiently determine the minimum cost path.

#### **Step 1: Construct a Graph of Valid Jumps**
We create an adjacency list (`adjacency_list`) where:
1. **Increasing case:** `nums[i] <= nums[j]`, ensuring `nums[k] < nums[i]` for `i < k < j`
2. **Decreasing case:** `nums[i] > nums[j]`, ensuring `nums[k] >= nums[i]` for `i < k < j`

- We maintain **two monotonic stacks**:
  - `increasing_stack`: Stores indices such that values are **increasing**.
  - `decreasing_stack`: Stores indices such that values are **non-increasing**.

By iterating **backwards** (`n-1` to `0`), we efficiently determine the valid jumps for each index in **O(n)**.

#### **Step 2: Compute Minimum Cost Using Dynamic Programming**
- We use `min_cost[i]` to store the minimum cost to reach index `i`.
- Start with `min_cost[0] = 0`.
- Iterate through each index and update its valid next indices using **relaxation**:
  - `min_cost[next_index] = min(min_cost[next_index], min_cost[i] + costs[next_index])`

This step ensures **we always take the least expensive path**.

#### **Time Complexity Analysis**
1. **Graph Construction (Monotonic Stack) â†’ `O(n)`**
   - Each element is pushed/popped at most once.
2. **DP Update (Relaxation) â†’ `O(n)`**
   - Each node is visited and relaxed at most once.

Thus, the overall complexity is **O(n)**, making this approach **efficient for large inputs** (`n â‰¤ 100,000`).

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1**
```python
nums = [3,2,4,4,1]
costs = [3,7,6,4,2]
```
**Valid Jumps:**
- `0 â†’ 2` (`3 â†’ 4` with cost `6`)
- `2 â†’ 4` (`4 â†’ 1` with cost `2`)

**Minimum Cost Path:**
- `0 â†’ 2 (cost = 6)`
- `2 â†’ 4 (cost = 2)`

**Total Minimum Cost:** `8`

---

### **Why This Works Efficiently**
- **Monotonic stacks** allow us to efficiently **find valid jumps** in `O(n)`.
- **Dynamic programming** ensures we **only update each node optimally once**.
- **Graph-based approach avoids brute-force `O(n^2)` checking**, making it scalable.

This is an **optimal** and **efficient** approach to solve the problem in `O(n)`. ðŸš€

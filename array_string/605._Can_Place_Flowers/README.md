To solve the problem, we can iterate through the `flowerbed` array and check where new flowers can be planted without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule. Here's an efficient implementation:

### **Python Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0  # Track the number of flowers we can plant
        length = len(flowerbed)

        for i in range(length):
            # Check if the current plot is empty and its neighbors are also empty or out of bounds
            if flowerbed[i] == 0 and (i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0) and (i == length - 1 or flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
                flowerbed[i] = 1  # Plant a flower here
                count += 1
                if count >= n:  # Early exit if we've planted enough flowers
                    return True

        return count >= n  # Return whether we could plant at least `n` flowers
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Iterate Through `flowerbed`**:
   - Check each plot in the array. If it is `0` (empty), verify that:
     - The left neighbor (`i - 1`) is either out of bounds or `0`.
     - The right neighbor (`i + 1`) is either out of bounds or `0`.

2. **Plant a Flower**:
   - If the conditions are met, plant a flower at index `i` by setting `flowerbed[i] = 1`.
   - Increment the `count` of flowers planted.

3. **Early Exit**:
   - If the number of flowers planted (`count`) meets or exceeds `n`, return `True`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After traversing the array, return whether the number of flowers planted is at least `n`.

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(f)\), where \(f\) is the length of the `flowerbed`. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we modify the `flowerbed` in-place without using extra space.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:
Input:
```python
flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 1
```

Execution:
- Can plant one flower at index `2`.
- `flowerbed` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
Output:
```python
True
```

#### Example 2:
Input:
```python
flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
n = 2
```

Execution:
- Can plant one flower at index `2`.
- No more valid positions available.
Output:
```python
False
```

#### Example 3:
Input:
```python
flowerbed = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
n = 2
```

Execution:
- Can plant flowers at indices `0` and `2`.
- `flowerbed` becomes `[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]`.
Output:
```python
True
```

This solution ensures an optimal approach that adheres to the problem constraints.

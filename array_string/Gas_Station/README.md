To solve this problem, we need to figure out whether it's possible to complete a circular route starting from a gas station and returning to it, given the amount of gas available and the cost to move to the next station. The main goal is to find the starting station index that allows us to complete the journey. If it's not possible, we should return `-1`.

### Approach:
1. **Feasibility Check**: If the total amount of gas available across all stations is less than the total cost required to complete the entire trip, it's impossible to complete the circuit, and we return `-1`.
2. **Greedy Approach**:
    - Start iterating through the stations. Track the gas available and the gas required.
    - Whenever the gas in the tank drops below zero, reset the starting point to the next station and reset the tank. This is because we can't start the trip from a station that leads to a deficit before completing the circle.
    - Keep track of the gas balance during the iteration. If the total balance of gas after one full pass is positive, the solution is guaranteed to be unique.

### Algorithm:
1. Calculate the total gas and the total cost for all stations. If the total gas is less than the total cost, return `-1`.
2. Start iterating over the stations, maintaining a `tank` (the current balance of gas).
3. If at any point the `tank` becomes negative, it means starting from that point won’t allow completing the journey, so we set the next station as the new starting point and reset the `tank`.
4. At the end of the iteration, return the index of the starting station if a valid solution is found.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        total_gas, total_cost, tank, start_index = 0, 0, 0, 0

        for i in range(len(gas)):
            total_gas += gas[i]
            total_cost += cost[i]
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]

            # If the tank is negative, reset start index to i + 1
            if tank < 0:
                start_index = i + 1
                tank = 0

        # If total gas is less than total cost, return -1
        if total_gas < total_cost:
            return -1

        return start_index
```

### Explanation:
1. **total_gas** and **total_cost**: These variables accumulate the total amount of gas available and the total amount of gas needed to complete the circuit. If `total_gas < total_cost`, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so we return `-1`.
2. **tank**: This tracks the current balance of gas as we move from station to station. If the `tank` ever drops below 0, it means starting from the current starting point would not allow us to complete the circuit, so we move the starting point to the next station and reset the `tank`.
3. **start_index**: This keeps track of the potential starting station. If the `tank` ever becomes negative, we move the starting point to the next station and reset the `tank` to 0.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of gas stations. We only iterate through the list of stations once to compute the total gas, total cost, and find the starting point.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** since we are only using a few additional variables to keep track of the total gas, total cost, and the current balance of gas.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
- Total gas = 15, Total cost = 15 → It's possible to complete the circuit.
- Start iterating:
    - `i = 0`: tank = -2 → Reset start to `i = 1`, reset `tank = 0`.
    - `i = 1`: tank = -2 → Reset start to `i = 2`, reset `tank = 0`.
    - `i = 2`: tank = -2 → Reset start to `i = 3`, reset `tank = 0`.
    - `i = 3`: tank = 3 → Continue.
    - `i = 4`: tank = 6 → Continue.
- Final answer is `start_index = 3`.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `gas = [2, 3, 4]`, `cost = [3, 4, 3]`
- Total gas = 9, Total cost = 10 → It's not possible to complete the circuit, so return `-1`.

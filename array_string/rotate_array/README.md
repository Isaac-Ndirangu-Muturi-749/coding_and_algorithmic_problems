To solve the problem of rotating an array to the right by `k` steps, there are several approaches to achieve this. Let's go through a few strategies and discuss the most efficient solution, focusing on the **in-place** method with **O(1) extra space**.

### Key Observations:
1. **Modulus Optimization**: Rotating an array of length `n` by `k` steps is equivalent to rotating by `k % n` steps. This means if `k >= n`, we can reduce the number of steps by taking the modulus, i.e., `k = k % n`.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and `k = 3`, rotating it by 3 steps to the right results in: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

### Three Approaches:

#### 1. **Using Extra Array (Space: O(n))**
   - Create a new array, copy elements from the original array in a rotated order, and then overwrite the original array.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) (for the extra array)

```python
def rotate(nums: list[int], k: int) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
```

#### 2. **In-Place with Cyclic Replacements (Space: O(1))**
   - Treat the array as a circle, and perform cyclic replacements for each element by moving it to its new position.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

   Steps:
   1. Calculate the new position for each element and move it in cycles.
   2. If all elements have been moved, stop.

```python
def rotate(nums: list[int], k: int) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    count = 0
    start = 0

    while count < n:
        current = start
        prev = nums[start]

        while True:
            next_idx = (current + k) % n
            nums[next_idx], prev = prev, nums[next_idx]
            current = next_idx
            count += 1

            if start == current:
                break

        start += 1
```

#### 3. **In-Place Reversal Algorithm (Optimal Solution, Space: O(1))**
   - This method involves reversing parts of the array:
     1. Reverse the whole array.
     2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
     3. Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)

   Steps:
   1. Reverse the entire array.
   2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
   3. Reverse the rest of the array (from `k` to `n-1`).

```python
def rotate(nums: list[int], k: int) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n

    # Helper function to reverse a portion of the array
    def reverse(start, end):
        while start < end:
            nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    # Step 1: Reverse the entire array
    reverse(0, n - 1)

    # Step 2: Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(0, k - 1)

    # Step 3: Reverse the rest of the array
    reverse(k, n - 1)
```

### Example Walkthrough of the Reversal Approach:

For `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and `k = 3`:
1. Reverse the whole array:
   - Before reversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - After reversal: `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

2. Reverse the first `k` elements (`k = 3`):
   - Before reversal: `[7, 6, 5]`
   - After reversal: `[5, 6, 7]`
   - Array becomes: `[5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

3. Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements:
   - Before reversal: `[4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - After reversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Final array: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we are performing constant-time swaps on each element in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are doing the operations in place without any extra array.

### Conclusion:
The **reversal algorithm** is the optimal solution for this problem, achieving the desired rotation in **O(n)** time complexity and using only **O(1)** extra space.

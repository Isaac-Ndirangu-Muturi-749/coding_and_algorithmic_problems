To solve the "Container With Most Water" problem efficiently, we can use the **two-pointer technique**. Here's the approach:

### Approach:

1. **Two pointers**:
   - Start with one pointer at the beginning (`left`) and another pointer at the end (`right`) of the array `height`.

2. **Calculate the area**:
   - For the current container formed between the lines at index `left` and `right`, the area is determined by:
     - The width, which is the distance between the two lines (`right - left`).
     - The height, which is the minimum of `height[left]` and `height[right]`.
   - Calculate the area as `min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.

3. **Move the pointers**:
   - To maximize the area, we want to try different pairs of lines. The idea is to move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, hoping to find a taller line that can produce a larger area.
   - If `height[left] < height[right]`, move the `left` pointer right (`left += 1`).
   - Otherwise, move the `right` pointer left (`right -= 1`).

4. **Repeat the process**:
   - Continue this process until the two pointers meet, and track the maximum area encountered during this process.

This method ensures that we examine every possible container configuration but without needing to use nested loops, giving a time complexity of **O(n)**.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            # Calculate the current area
            width = right - left
            current_height = min(height[left], height[right])
            current_area = current_height * width

            # Update the maximum area found
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

            # Move the pointers
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_area
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize two pointers: `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the array.
   - We also initialize `max_area` to track the maximum area found so far.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - For each pair of lines between `left` and `right`, we calculate the area based on the shorter of the two lines and the distance between them.
   - After calculating the area, we compare it to the `max_area` and update `max_area` if the current area is larger.
   - We then move the pointer corresponding to the shorter line inward, trying to find a taller line that could form a larger area.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when the two pointers meet, ensuring that all possible container configurations have been considered.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We process each element of the array once, moving the `left` or `right` pointer inward on each step.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We are only using a few variables to track the pointers and the maximum area, so the space usage is constant.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
```
1. Start with `left = 0` and `right = 8`.
   - Width = `8 - 0 = 8`
   - Height = `min(height[0], height[8]) = min(1, 7) = 1`
   - Area = `1 * 8 = 8`
   - Move the `left` pointer to 1 because `height[left] < height[right]`.

2. Now `left = 1` and `right = 8`.
   - Width = `8 - 1 = 7`
   - Height = `min(height[1], height[8]) = min(8, 7) = 7`
   - Area = `7 * 7 = 49`
   - Move the `right` pointer to 7.

3. Now `left = 1` and `right = 7`.
   - Width = `7 - 1 = 6`
   - Height = `min(height[1], height[7]) = min(8, 3) = 3`
   - Area = `3 * 6 = 18`
   - Move the `right` pointer to 6.

4. Now `left = 1` and `right = 6`.
   - Width = `6 - 1 = 5`
   - Height = `min(height[1], height[6]) = min(8, 8) = 8`
   - Area = `8 * 5 = 40`
   - Move the `right` pointer to 5.

5. Continue this process until the two pointers meet. The largest area found is 49.

### Example 2:
```python
height = [1, 1]
```
- Width = `1 - 0 = 1`
- Height = `min(1, 1) = 1`
- Area = `1 * 1 = 1`

### Conclusion:
The two-pointer approach efficiently finds the maximum area a container can hold while maintaining constant space complexity.

To solve this problem optimally, we can use a **greedy algorithm** approach by following these steps:

### Key Idea:
- We need to minimize the number of arrows shot, which means we should try to group as many overlapping balloons as possible and burst them with a single arrow.
- If two balloons overlap, they can be burst by the same arrow. We shoot the arrow at the minimum possible x-coordinate that can burst the most balloons.

### Steps:
1. **Sort the balloons** by their end coordinate (`xend`). This allows us to process the balloons in a way where we can always burst the maximum number of overlapping balloons with one arrow.

2. **Iterate over the sorted balloons**:
   - Track the position where the last arrow was shot (initially set to the end of the first balloon).
   - For each balloon, if its start (`xstart`) is greater than the position of the last arrow, it means this balloon cannot be burst by the current arrow, and we need to shoot a new one. Update the arrow position to the end of the current balloon.

3. **Result**: The total number of arrows will be the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def findMinArrowShots(points):
    if not points:
        return 0

    # Sort the balloons by their xend values (end of the diameter)
    points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    arrows = 1  # At least one arrow is needed
    last_arrow_position = points[0][1]  # Position of the first arrow at the end of the first balloon

    # Iterate through the sorted points
    for xstart, xend in points:
        # If the current balloon's start is greater than the last arrow's position, shoot a new arrow
        if xstart > last_arrow_position:
            arrows += 1
            last_arrow_position = xend  # Update the position of the last arrow to the current balloon's end

    return arrows
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Sorting**: We first sort the balloons by their `xend` coordinate (end of the balloon’s diameter). This ensures that when we place an arrow, it bursts as many balloons as possible.
2. **Initial arrow**: We start by shooting the first arrow at the end of the first balloon.
3. **Looping through balloons**:
   - For each balloon, if its start is greater than the position where the last arrow was shot, it means this balloon cannot be burst by that arrow, so we need to shoot a new arrow.
   - We then update the position of the last arrow to the end of the current balloon.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the balloons takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of balloons.
- Iterating through the balloons takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]`

1. **Sorted balloons by their end coordinates**:
   ```
   [[1,6], [2,8], [7,12], [10,16]]
   ```

2. **Processing**:
   - Start with the first balloon `[1,6]`, shoot an arrow at `x = 6`.
   - The second balloon `[2,8]` starts before `6` and ends after `6`, so it can be burst with the same arrow.
   - The third balloon `[7,12]` starts after `6`, so we shoot another arrow at `x = 12`.
   - The fourth balloon `[10,16]` can be burst with the same arrow since its start is before `12`.

3. **Result**: 2 arrows are needed.

#### Example 2:
Input: `points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]`

1. **Sorted balloons**: `[[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]]`
2. Each balloon is isolated (no overlaps), so we need 4 arrows.

#### Example 3:
Input: `points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]`

1. **Sorted balloons**: `[[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5]]`
2. **Processing**:
   - Shoot the first arrow at `x = 2` (bursting the first two balloons `[1,2]` and `[2,3]`).
   - Shoot another arrow at `x = 4` (bursting the next two balloons `[3,4]` and `[4,5]`).

3. **Result**: 2 arrows are needed.

### Conclusion:
This greedy approach efficiently finds the minimum number of arrows by always shooting at the end of the current balloon and checking for overlaps with the next ones.


A **greedy algorithm** is an approach used in optimization problems where the algorithm makes the best or most optimal choice at each step of the problem-solving process, with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

### Key Features of Greedy Algorithms:

1. **Greedy Choice Property**:
   - The algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment, or **locally optimal**. It doesn’t look into the future to see if the current choice will lead to the best solution in the end.

2. **Optimal Substructure**:
   - The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and the solution to the overall problem can be constructed from the solutions to the subproblems. This means that solving subproblems optimally leads to solving the main problem optimally.

3. **Once a Choice is Made**:
   - Once the greedy choice is made, it cannot be reversed or modified. The algorithm moves on to the next step.

### Example of a Greedy Algorithm: Coin Change Problem

Imagine you need to make change for a certain amount using the least number of coins from a set of coin denominations (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25 cents).

#### Problem:
Given coin denominations `[25, 10, 5, 1]` and an amount `30`, find the minimum number of coins needed.

#### Greedy Approach:
1. Start with the highest denomination (25 cents).
2. Subtract 25 from 30, leaving 5 cents.
3. Take one 5-cent coin to cover the remaining amount.
4. In total, you used 2 coins: one 25-cent coin and one 5-cent coin.

This greedy approach works for this case, as it finds the optimal solution by selecting the largest coin first.

### When Greedy Algorithms Work Well:
- **Greedy algorithms** are ideal when the problem has the **greedy choice property** and **optimal substructure**, such as:
  - **Dijkstra’s algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a graph.
  - **Prim’s algorithm** for finding a minimum spanning tree.
  - **Huffman coding** for data compression.

### When Greedy Algorithms May Not Work:
- **Greedy algorithms** are not guaranteed to always produce the globally optimal solution for all types of problems. For example:
  - In the **knapsack problem**, where you need to maximize the value of items that fit into a knapsack, a greedy algorithm might fail to produce the optimal solution because it only looks at the item with the highest immediate value-to-weight ratio, ignoring better overall combinations of items.

### Summary:
- A **greedy algorithm** makes a sequence of choices that look best at each step, and it works well when each local choice leads to an optimal solution.
- However, it may not always guarantee the globally optimal solution, and it’s important to verify that the problem satisfies the **greedy choice property** for the algorithm to be effective.

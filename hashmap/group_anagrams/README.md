To group the anagrams together from an array of strings, we can use a dictionary where the keys are a representation of the anagram and the values are lists of strings that belong to that anagram group.

### Approach:

1. **Key Insight**: Anagrams, when sorted, produce the same string. For example, "eat", "tea", and "ate" all become "aet" when sorted. This can be used as a key in a dictionary.

2. **Steps**:
   - Traverse each string in the list `strs`.
   - For each string, sort its characters alphabetically and use the sorted string as the key in a dictionary.
   - Append the original string to the list that corresponds to that key.
   - Finally, return the values of the dictionary, which are the groups of anagrams.

### Code Implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
    # Dictionary to hold lists of anagrams
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)

    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for s in strs:
        # Sort the string and use it as a key
        sorted_str = ''.join(sorted(s))
        # Append the original string to the list corresponding to the sorted key
        anagram_map[sorted_str].append(s)

    # Return the list of anagram groups
    return list(anagram_map.values())
```

### Example 1:
**Input**: `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`

**Output**:
```python
[["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### Example 2:
**Input**: `[""]`

**Output**:
```python
[[""]]
```

### Example 3:
**Input**: `["a"]`

**Output**:
```python
[["a"]]
```

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting each string takes \(O(k \log k)\) time, where \(k\) is the length of the string. If there are \(n\) strings in the list, the total time complexity will be \(O(n \cdot k \log k)\), where \(n\) is the number of strings and \(k\) is the maximum length of a string in `strs`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the number of strings and \(k\) is the maximum length of a string in `strs`, since we store all strings and their sorted versions in the dictionary.


To group anagrams using ASCII values, we can create a character frequency count for each string instead of sorting the characters. This frequency count can serve as a unique key for each group of anagrams.

### Approach:

1. **Key Insight**: Each string can be represented by a fixed-size tuple (or list) that counts the occurrences of each character. Since we are dealing with lowercase English letters, we can use a list of size 26 (for 'a' to 'z') to count the occurrences.

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a list of size 26 for each string to count character frequencies.
   - Convert the frequency list to a tuple (to use it as a key in a dictionary).
   - Store the original string in a dictionary where the key is the character frequency tuple.
   - Finally, return the values of the dictionary.

### Code Implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def groupAnagrams(strs: list[str]) -> list[list[str]]:
    # Dictionary to hold lists of anagrams
    anagram_map = defaultdict(list)

    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for s in strs:
        # Initialize a frequency list of size 26 for 'a' to 'z'
        count = [0] * 26

        # Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for char in s:
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

        # Convert the list to a tuple to use as a key
        key = tuple(count)

        # Append the original string to the list corresponding to the frequency key
        anagram_map[key].append(s)

    # Return the list of anagram groups
    return list(anagram_map.values())
```

### Example 1:
**Input**: `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`

**Output**:
```python
[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### Example 2:
**Input**: `[""]`

**Output**:
```python
[[""]]
```

### Example 3:
**Input**: `["a"]`

**Output**:
```python
[["a"]]
```

### Time Complexity:
- Counting the frequency of characters takes \(O(k)\) time for each string, where \(k\) is the length of the string. For \(n\) strings, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\).

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) for storing the original strings in the dictionary, along with the space for the frequency lists (though they are reused for each string).

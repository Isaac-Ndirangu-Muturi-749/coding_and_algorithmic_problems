To determine if a number `n` is a "happy number," we need to repeatedly replace the number with the sum of the squares of its digits until:
1. We reach `1`, which indicates that the number is happy.
2. We encounter a cycle, indicating that the number is not happy because it will never reach `1`.

### Key Observations:
- If the process encounters a number that it has already seen, it means that the process is in a cycle, and the number is not happy.
- We can use a set to keep track of numbers we have already encountered during the process.

### Approach:
1. Initialize a helper function to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of a number.
2. Use a loop to repeatedly update the number with the sum of squares of its digits.
3. If the number becomes `1`, return `True` (the number is happy).
4. If the number is repeated (detected using a set), return `False` (the number is in a cycle and thus not happy).

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(number: int) -> int:
            total_sum = 0
            while number > 0:
                digit = number % 10
                total_sum += digit * digit
                number //= 10
            return total_sum

        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = get_next(n)

        return n == 1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Helper Function (`get_next`)**:
   - Takes an integer `number` and computes the sum of the squares of its digits. It keeps extracting digits using the modulus operation (`% 10`), squaring each, and adding them up.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop keeps checking if `n` equals `1` (in which case the number is happy and we return `True`).
   - It also checks if `n` is in the `seen` set, which means we've encountered a cycle, and the number is not happy (we return `False`).

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `n` equals `1` (happy number) or we detect a cycle (not a happy number).

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the number of digits in the number. In each iteration, we calculate the sum of the squares of the digits, which takes O(d) time, where d is the number of digits. On average, the process will not take too many iterations due to the decreasing nature of the number.
- **Space complexity:** O(log n) for storing previously seen numbers in the `seen` set.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 19
Output: True
```
- Sequence: 19 → 82 → 68 → 100 → 1 (Happy number).

#### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 2
Output: False
```
- Sequence: 2 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 (Cycle detected, not a happy number).



Yes, you can use a hashmap (or more commonly, a Python dictionary) to track the numbers you've already seen in the process, just as you would use a set. The hashmap will help you detect cycles in the process of checking whether a number is happy. However, since we only care about whether a number has been seen before (and not any additional data), using a set is generally simpler and more efficient.

Nevertheless, here's how you could implement the solution using a hashmap (dictionary):

### Approach Using a Hashmap:
- Use a hashmap (or dictionary) to store numbers you've seen during the process. If the same number is encountered again, you know a cycle exists, and the number is not happy.
- If the number becomes 1, return `True`, because the number is happy.

### Code Implementation with Hashmap:

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(number: int) -> int:
            total_sum = 0
            while number > 0:
                digit = number % 10
                total_sum += digit * digit
                number //= 10
            return total_sum

        seen = {}
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen[n] = True  # Store the number in the hashmap
            n = get_next(n)

        return n == 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Helper Function (`get_next`)**:
   - The same as in the previous solution, it computes the sum of the squares of the digits of `number`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop checks if `n` equals `1`. If so, the number is happy, and we return `True`.
   - It also checks if `n` exists in the `seen` hashmap. If `n` is already present, it means a cycle is detected, and the number is not happy (we return `False`).
   - Each new value of `n` is added to the hashmap with a dummy value (e.g., `True`) to track it.

3. **Termination**:
   - If `n` becomes `1`, we return `True` (indicating a happy number).
   - If `n` is found in the hashmap (cycle detected), we return `False` (indicating it's not a happy number).

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the number of digits in the number. The same reasoning applies as in the set-based solution.
- **Space complexity:** O(log n), because we store the previously encountered numbers in the hashmap (just like we would in a set).

### Comparison:
- The **hashmap** solution doesn't provide any performance gain over the **set** solution. In fact, using a set is slightly more efficient since we don't need to store any values—just the presence of the number.
- Both the set and hashmap approaches are O(1) for insertion and lookup, making them suitable for this problem.

If you just need to check for the presence of previously encountered numbers, a set is preferable. However, a hashmap can also be used if, for example, you need to store additional information (e.g., the number of times a number has been encountered).

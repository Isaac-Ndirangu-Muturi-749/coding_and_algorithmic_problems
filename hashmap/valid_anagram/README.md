To solve the problem of checking whether two strings, `s` and `t`, are anagrams, we need to determine if `t` is a rearrangement of `s`. An anagram means that both strings contain the exact same characters with the same frequencies.

### Approach:

1. **Length Check**: If the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, they cannot be anagrams, so we can return `false` immediately.
2. **Character Count**: For two strings to be anagrams, they must contain the same characters with the exact same frequencies. One way to check this is by counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and comparing the results.
3. **Hash Table (Dictionary)**: We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`. If the counts match for all characters, then the strings are anagrams.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Create dictionaries to count frequencies of characters
        count_s = {}
        count_t = {}

        # Count frequencies of characters in s
        for char in s:
            count_s[char] = count_s.get(char, 0) + 1

        # Count frequencies of characters in t
        for char in t:
            count_t[char] = count_t.get(char, 0) + 1

        # Compare the frequency dictionaries
        return count_s == count_t
```

### Explanation:

1. **Length Comparison**: We first compare the lengths of `s` and `t`. If they are not equal, we immediately return `false` since they cannot be anagrams.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: We use two dictionaries, `count_s` and `count_t`, to store the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`.
3. **Comparison**: Finally, we compare the two dictionaries. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. We traverse each string once to count the frequencies and then compare the two dictionaries.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, since the dictionaries store at most 26 characters (for lowercase English letters), which is constant space.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```python
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
```
- Both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies. Therefore, the function will return `True`.

#### Example 2:
```python
s = "rat"
t = "car"
```
- The characters and frequencies do not match, so the function will return `False`.


### Hash Map vs. Hash Table

The terms **hash map** and **hash table** are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. Let's break down each term to understand the distinction:

### 1. **Hash Table:**
- **Definition:** A **hash table** is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- **How it works:**
    - A hash function takes the key and converts it into an integer (hash code). This hash code determines where the key-value pair will be stored in the array.
    - Each slot in the array contains a bucket (list or another structure) where values are stored. In case of collisions (multiple keys hashing to the same index), the bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs (e.g., via chaining or open addressing).
- **Usage:** The term "hash table" generally refers to the underlying data structure that implements a mapping from keys to values, with efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions.

- **Language Usage:**
    - In low-level languages like **C**, the term hash table is more common. The underlying structure is often implemented using arrays and pointers.

### 2. **Hash Map:**
- **Definition:** A **hash map** is a specific implementation of a hash table that maps keys to values.
- **How it works:** It relies on a hash table internally to store key-value pairs but is often implemented with added functionality like dynamic resizing, load factor management, and thread-safety in higher-level languages.
- **Usage:** Hash maps are often discussed in the context of programming languages like **Java** or **Python**, which provide hash map-like data structures as part of their standard libraries (e.g., `HashMap` in Java or `dict` in Python).

- **Language Usage:**
    - **Java** has a class called `HashMap`, which is a concrete implementation of the **Map** interface and internally uses a hash table to manage key-value pairs.
    - **Python's `dict`** is essentially a hash map.

### Key Differences:

| **Aspect**         | **Hash Table**                               | **Hash Map**                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **General Concept** | Data structure that uses a hash function to store key-value pairs. | A specific implementation of a hash table that maps keys to values. |
| **Terminology**     | Used more broadly to refer to the underlying data structure. | Often refers to specific implementations like `HashMap` in Java. |
| **Language Context**| Commonly used in lower-level languages like C. | Often used in higher-level languages like Java, Python, or C++. |
| **Thread Safety**   | No built-in thread safety (depends on implementation). | Can have built-in thread safety mechanisms like `ConcurrentHashMap` in Java. |
| **Resizing**        | May or may not support resizing. | Typically supports dynamic resizing based on load factor. |

### Example in **Java**:
```java
HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("apple", 1);
map.put("banana", 2);

System.out.println(map.get("apple"));  // Output: 1
```

### Example in **Python** (Using `dict`):
```python
my_dict = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2}

print(my_dict['apple'])  # Output: 1
```

### Summary:
- **Hash Table** is a more general term for a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function.
- **Hash Map** is a specific implementation of a hash table with additional features, often provided as a part of a high-level language's library.

Both provide efficient O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.


To determine whether two strings `s` and `t` are anagrams, we need to check if the two strings have the exact same characters with the same frequencies. Let's break down the approach and then address the follow-up regarding Unicode characters.

### Approach:

1. **Check Lengths:**
   - If the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, they can't be anagrams. Return `false` immediately.

2. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Use a dictionary (or a counter) to count how many times each character appears in both strings. If both strings have the same counts for each character, they are anagrams.

3. **Compare Counts:**
   - Compare the frequency counts of both strings. If they match, return `true`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Solution (Python Code):

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # If lengths are not the same, s and t can't be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Count the frequency of characters in both strings
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Check Lengths**: We first check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, in which case, we immediately return `false` because they can't be anagrams.
2. **Use `Counter`**: The `Counter` from Python’s `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each character in both strings. If both strings have identical counts for each character, `Counter(s) == Counter(t)` will return `true`.
3. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because we are simply counting the characters in each string and then comparing the counts.

### Example 1:
```python
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
# Output: True
```
- Both strings contain the characters: {'a': 3, 'n': 1, 'g': 1, 'r': 1, 'm': 1}.
- Since the character frequencies match, the function returns `True`.

### Example 2:
```python
s = "rat"
t = "car"
# Output: False
```
- `s` contains: {'r': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1}
- `t` contains: {'c': 1, 'a': 1, 'r': 1}
- The character counts are different, so the function returns `False`.

### Follow-up (Handling Unicode Characters):
The solution would work for Unicode characters as well because Python’s `Counter` and string handling support Unicode by default. You don't need any special adjustments. Here’s how:

- **Unicode Strings**: The same approach can handle strings with Unicode characters because Python treats them like any other characters.
- **For large Unicode strings**: If the input strings can be extremely large and contain many different characters, you can still use the same logic, but ensure that your environment has sufficient memory to handle the `Counter` efficiently.

The key idea is that the underlying character comparison works similarly whether the strings contain regular ASCII characters or Unicode ones.


Your current solution works well for ASCII characters, but it also applies to Unicode characters since Python strings can handle Unicode characters natively. In Python, the `str` type is designed to handle any Unicode character, so the approach you are using would still work correctly for Unicode strings without requiring any significant changes.

### Explanation of Unicode Handling:

1. **Unicode Characters**: Unicode strings in Python are fully supported by the dictionary data structure, and the `str` type can store both ASCII and non-ASCII characters. This means that your frequency count approach using dictionaries (`count_s` and `count_t`) will work as expected, regardless of whether the characters are simple ASCII or complex Unicode symbols.

2. **Handling Unicode**: When counting characters using `count_s.get(char, 0)`, Python will count Unicode characters the same way it counts ASCII characters. The comparison `count_s == count_t` will still work because Python compares dictionary keys and values correctly, even when they are Unicode characters.

### Optimizing Further:

While the solution works as it is for both ASCII and Unicode, here's an alternative approach using a more optimized method with constant space complexity if you want to avoid multiple dictionaries:

### Optimized Solution Using Sorting (Still Handles Unicode):

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Sort both strings and compare them
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the strings (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if sorting is done in-place (though Python's `sorted()` returns a new list, which uses O(n) space).

### Optimized Solution Using Character Count (Still Handles Unicode):

For a more optimal solution using constant space, you can use a single frequency dictionary to count characters from `s` and subtract counts for characters in `t`:

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # If lengths are different, they cannot be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        # Create a dictionary to count frequencies of characters
        count = {}

        # Count frequencies in string s
        for char in s:
            count[char] = count.get(char, 0) + 1

        # Subtract frequencies in string t
        for char in t:
            if char not in count:
                return False
            count[char] -= 1
            if count[char] == 0:
                del count[char]

        # If count dictionary is empty, they are anagrams
        return len(count) == 0
```

### Key Points:
- This approach also works with Unicode characters because Python's `str` type supports Unicode.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** in theory because you're only using a single dictionary for counting, which reduces space usage compared to using two dictionaries.

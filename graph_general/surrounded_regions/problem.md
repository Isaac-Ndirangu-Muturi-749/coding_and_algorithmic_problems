# Problem Statement: surrounded_regions
```
rd.



Example 1:

Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

Explanation:


In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

Example 2:

Input: board = [["X"]]

Output: [["X"]]



Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

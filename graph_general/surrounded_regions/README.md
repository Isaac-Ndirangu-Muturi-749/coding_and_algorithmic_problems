To solve the problem of capturing regions in the board, you can follow the below steps:

### Approach:

1. **Identify Edge 'O's**:
   - Any 'O' that is connected to the edge cannot be surrounded by 'X's. These 'O's, along with any 'O's connected to them, should not be flipped to 'X'.

2. **Mark Non-surrounded Regions**:
   - From the edges, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for all 'O's that are connected to the boundary. Mark these 'O's as safe (let's temporarily mark them as something like 'T').

3. **Flip Remaining 'O's**:
   - Any remaining 'O' cells that are not connected to the boundary can be safely flipped to 'X'.

4. **Revert the Temporary Marks**:
   - Change all the 'T' cells (temporary marks for safe 'O's) back to 'O' as these were not surrounded.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Traverse the boundary of the board. Whenever an 'O' is found, initiate a DFS/BFS from that position to mark all connected 'O's (which cannot be captured) as 'T'.

2. After processing the boundary, go through the entire board. Any remaining 'O's are surrounded, so they should be changed to 'X'. Revert the temporary 'T' marks back to 'O'.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        if not board or not board[0]:
            return

        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        def dfs(r, c):
            # Out of bounds or not 'O', stop recursion
            if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or board[r][c] != 'O':
                return
            # Mark the current 'O' as 'T' (temporarily marking it as safe)
            board[r][c] = 'T'

            # Explore all 4 directions
            dfs(r + 1, c)  # down
            dfs(r - 1, c)  # up
            dfs(r, c + 1)  # right
            dfs(r, c - 1)  # left

        # Step 1: Traverse the boundary of the board and mark all connected 'O's as 'T'
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in [0, cols - 1]:  # only first and last column
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    dfs(i, j)

        for j in range(cols):
            for i in [0, rows - 1]:  # only first and last row
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    dfs(i, j)

        # Step 2: Go through the board and flip 'O' to 'X', and 'T' back to 'O'
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if board[i][j] == 'O':
                    board[i][j] = 'X'  # Capture surrounded regions
                elif board[i][j] == 'T':
                    board[i][j] = 'O'  # Revert non-surrounded regions

```

### Explanation:

1. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore all 'O' cells connected to the current 'O'. This includes cells in the up, down, left, and right directions.
   - We stop exploring if we reach the boundary of the board or if the cell is not 'O'.

2. **Marking Edge Connected 'O's**:
   - We first traverse the boundaries (rows and columns at the edges) of the matrix. For any 'O' found, we initiate a DFS to mark all connected 'O's as 'T'. These 'T's represent the regions that cannot be captured.

3. **Flipping and Reverting**:
   - After marking, we traverse the entire matrix. If an 'O' is not connected to the boundary, we flip it to 'X' because it's surrounded. We then revert any temporary 'T' marks back to 'O' as they were not surrounded.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We may visit every cell in the board a constant number of times during the DFS calls.

- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) in the worst case for the recursion stack (DFS) or queue (BFS).

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's take the first example input:

```
Input:
board = [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","O","X"],
         ["X","X","O","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

1. **Mark Edge-Connected 'O's**:
   - After processing the boundary, the board becomes:

   ```
   [["X","X","X","X"],
    ["X","O","O","X"],
    ["X","X","O","X"],
    ["X","T","X","X"]]   # The 'O' at the bottom left is marked as 'T'
   ```

2. **Flip and Revert**:
   - We flip all the remaining 'O's to 'X' and revert the 'T' back to 'O':

   ```
   [["X","X","X","X"],
    ["X","X","X","X"],
    ["X","X","X","X"],
    ["X","O","X","X"]]
   ```

### Final Output:

```
Output:
[["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","X","X","X"],
 ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

This solution ensures that we only capture regions fully surrounded by 'X's, while regions connected to the boundary are left intact.

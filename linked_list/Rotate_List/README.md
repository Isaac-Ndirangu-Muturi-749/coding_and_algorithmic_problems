To solve this problem, we need to rotate a linked list to the right by `k` places. A key observation is that rotating the list by its length (`n`) results in no change, so we can reduce the number of rotations by taking `k % n` where `n` is the length of the list.

### Plan:
1. **Find the length of the linked list**: Traverse the list to calculate its length.
2. **Connect the last node to the head**: This creates a circular linked list.
3. **Break the circle at the appropriate point**: We break the circle after `n - (k % n)` nodes from the start to achieve the desired rotation.
4. **Handle edge cases**: Ensure the function works for cases where `head` is `None` or when `k` is 0 or a multiple of `n`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        if not head or not head.next or k == 0:
            return head

        # Step 1: Find the length of the list and get to the last node
        length = 1
        current = head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
            length += 1

        # Step 2: Make the list circular
        current.next = head

        # Step 3: Calculate the new head position (after n - k % n nodes)
        k = k % length
        steps_to_new_head = length - k
        new_tail = head
        for _ in range(steps_to_new_head - 1):
            new_tail = new_tail.next

        # Step 4: Break the circle and set the new head
        new_head = new_tail.next
        new_tail.next = None

        return new_head
```

### Explanation:
1. **Edge Case Handling**: If the list is empty (`head is None`), has only one node (`head.next is None`), or if `k == 0`, return the list as is.
2. **Find Length**: We traverse the list once to find its length and keep track of the last node to form the circular list later.
3. **Make Circular**: After calculating the length, we connect the last node's `next` pointer back to the `head`, making the list circular.
4. **Calculate the New Head**: We reduce the number of rotations by taking `k % length`. Then, we break the circular list at the correct position, which is `length - k` nodes from the current head. The node at this position becomes the new tail, and the node after it becomes the new head.
5. **Break the Circle**: Set the `next` pointer of the new tail to `None` to break the circular list.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2`
- **Length Calculation**: The length of the list is 5.
- **Circular List**: After connecting the last node (5) to the head, the list becomes circular: `[1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> ...]`.
- **Rotation Calculation**: `k % 5 = 2`, so we need to move `5 - 2 = 3` steps from the head to find the new tail.
- **Breaking the Circle**: After 3 steps, the new tail is node 3, and the new head is node 4. We break the circle after node 3.
- **Output**: `[4,5,1,2,3]`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `head = [0,1,2]`, `k = 4`
- **Length Calculation**: The length of the list is 3.
- **Circular List**: The list becomes circular: `[0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> ...]`.
- **Rotation Calculation**: `k % 3 = 1`, so we need to move `3 - 1 = 2` steps from the head to find the new tail.
- **Breaking the Circle**: After 2 steps, the new tail is node 1, and the new head is node 2. We break the circle after node 1.
- **Output**: `[2,0,1]`

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the linked list. We traverse the list twice: once to calculate its length and once to find the new tail.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**, since we are using constant extra space.


Let's break down this part of the code. This is likely from a function that rotates a linked list by `k` positions to the right.

### Context
- You have a singly linked list.
- The goal is to **rotate** the list by `k` positions to the right.
- After rotation, the list should be updated, and you need to find the new head and tail positions.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Handle Excess Rotations (`k = k % length`)**
```python
k = k % length
```
- Since rotating a list by its length `n` doesn't change it, you only need to rotate it by `k % length` positions.
- Example: If `k = 10` and the list length is `5`, rotating by `10` positions is the same as rotating by `10 % 5 = 0` positions, which means no rotation is needed.

#### 2. **Determine the New Head's Position**
```python
steps_to_new_head = length - k
```
- After calculating `k % length`, you need to find the new head of the rotated list.
- The new head will be `steps_to_new_head` positions from the current head.
  - If `k = 3`, for instance, the new head will be `length - 3` positions from the current head.
- This works because moving the list by `k` positions to the right is the same as moving the list by `length - k` positions to the left.

#### 3. **Traverse to Find the New Tail**
```python
new_tail = head
for _ in range(steps_to_new_head - 1):
    new_tail = new_tail.next
```
- To find the new tail (the node just before the new head), you traverse the list `steps_to_new_head - 1` steps starting from the current head.
- The node you end up at will be the new tail of the rotated list, because the node after it will become the new head.
  - For example, if `steps_to_new_head = 3`, you traverse the list 2 times (because `steps_to_new_head - 1 = 2`) to find the new tail.

### Example
If the list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 2`:
1. **Length of the list** = 5.
2. **New head** should be at position `5 - 2 = 3` (the node with value `3`).
3. **New tail** will be the node just before the new head, so you'll traverse `steps_to_new_head - 1 = 2` steps to find the node with value `2`, which becomes the new tail.

In the end, the new list after rotation will look like `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`.

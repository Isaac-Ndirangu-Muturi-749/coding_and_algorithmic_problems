To reverse the nodes of a singly linked list between two given positions, `left` and `right`, the goal is to modify the linked list such that the sublist between those two positions is reversed while keeping the rest of the list intact.

### Approach:
1. **Find the `left` node**: Traverse the list to find the node just before the position `left`.
2. **Reverse the sublist**: Reverse the portion of the list between positions `left` and `right`.
3. **Reconnect the nodes**: Once the sublist is reversed, reconnect the reversed portion back into the list.
4. **Return the updated list**.

To achieve this in **one pass** through the list, we can use the following approach:

### Algorithm:
1. First, set up a dummy node to simplify handling edge cases (e.g., reversing from the first node).
2. Traverse the list until you reach the node just before the `left`-th position.
3. Reverse the sublist from position `left` to `right`.
4. Reconnect the reversed sublist back to the rest of the list.
5. Return the new head of the list.

### Python Code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseBetween(head: ListNode, left: int, right: int) -> ListNode:
    # Edge case: If the list is empty or there's nothing to reverse
    if not head or left == right:
        return head

    # Step 1: Initialize a dummy node that points to the head
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev = dummy

    # Step 2: Move `prev` to the node just before the `left` position
    for _ in range(left - 1):
        prev = prev.next

    # Step 3: Reverse the sublist from left to right
    # `start` is the first node to be reversed, `then` is the node after `start`
    start = prev.next
    then = start.next

    # Reverse the sublist by adjusting pointers
    for _ in range(right - left):
        start.next = then.next
        then.next = prev.next
        prev.next = then
        then = start.next

    # Step 4: Return the new head of the list
    return dummy.next
```

### Explanation:

1. **Dummy Node**: We use a dummy node pointing to the head to handle the edge case where `left` is 1 (i.e., the head itself needs to be reversed).

2. **Find the `left - 1` node**: The `prev` pointer is moved to the node just before `left`. This is the node after which the reversal will happen.

3. **Reversing the sublist**:
    - The `start` pointer is the first node of the sublist to be reversed.
    - The `then` pointer is the node that follows `start`, and this is the node that will be moved during each iteration of the reversal.
    - For each iteration, we update the links by moving `then` in front of `start` and adjusting the next pointers.

4. **Reconnect**: After reversing the sublist, the reversed part is correctly connected to the rest of the list.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `left = 2`, `right = 4`
- Output: `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`

- Initial list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
- After the reversal of positions 2 to 4: `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `head = [5]`, `left = 1`, `right = 1`
- Output: `[5]`
- No reversal is needed as the sublist consists of a single node.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. We make one pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few pointers for manipulation and no additional data structures.


This code snippet reverses a sublist in a linked list. It adjusts the pointers between nodes in the sublist from position `left` to `right`, performing in-place reversal. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

### Key Terms:
- **`prev`**: This is the node just before the sublist that needs to be reversed.
- **`start`**: This is the first node in the sublist that will be reversed.
- **`then`**: This represents the node that comes right after `start`. During each iteration, it is moved to the front of the sublist (i.e., it becomes the new head of the sublist).

### Initial Setup:
- Before this code runs, the pointers `prev`, `start`, and `then` are already set up:
  - `prev` is pointing to the node just before the sublist to be reversed.
  - `start` is pointing to the first node in the sublist to be reversed (at position `left`).
  - `then` is pointing to the node immediately after `start`.

### Loop Explanation:

The loop runs `right - left` times, meaning it executes the number of times equal to the length of the sublist that needs to be reversed.

For each iteration, the following steps happen:

1. **Step 1: Disconnect `then` from the rest of the list**:
   - `start.next = then.next`: The `start` node skips over `then` and points directly to the node after `then`. This effectively "disconnects" the `then` node from its original position.

2. **Step 2: Insert `then` at the front of the sublist**:
   - `then.next = prev.next`: The `then` node is inserted right after `prev`. To do this, we make `then.next` point to whatever `prev.next` is currently pointing to (which is the current head of the reversed portion of the sublist).

3. **Step 3: Move `then` to the head of the reversed sublist**:
   - `prev.next = then`: This makes `prev.next` point to `then`, making `then` the new head of the reversed sublist.

4. **Step 4: Advance `then` to the next node**:
   - `then = start.next`: Since `then` has been moved, we need to move the `then` pointer to the next node in the original list (which is now at `start.next`). This prepares `then` for the next iteration, where it will also be moved to the front of the sublist.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's say we have the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, and we want to reverse the sublist between `left = 2` and `right = 4`, resulting in the list `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`.

- **Initial Setup**:
  - `prev` points to `1`, `start` points to `2`, and `then` points to `3`.

- **First iteration** (`right - left = 3 - 2 = 1`):
  - `start.next = 4` (i.e., `2` now skips over `3` and points to `4`).
  - `then.next = 2` (i.e., `3` now points to `2`, inserting `3` at the front of the sublist).
  - `prev.next = 3` (i.e., `1` now points to `3`, making `3` the new head of the reversed sublist).
  - `then = 4`.

- **Second iteration**:
  - `start.next = 5` (i.e., `2` now skips over `4` and points to `5`).
  - `then.next = 3` (i.e., `4` now points to `3`, inserting `4` at the front of the sublist).
  - `prev.next = 4` (i.e., `1` now points to `4`, making `4` the new head of the reversed sublist).
  - `then = 5`.

After two iterations, the sublist has been reversed, and the final list becomes `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`.

### Summary:
- The loop gradually moves nodes in the sublist to the front of the sublist, effectively reversing it in-place.
- The loop runs `right - left` times, ensuring that the entire sublist is reversed by adjusting pointers.
- Each iteration moves the node `then` to the front of the sublist and updates pointers accordingly.



The time complexity for looking up an element in an array depends on whether you're using a **sorted** or **unsorted** array and whether you're referring to a **random access** lookup or a **search**:

### 1. **Random Access (Index Lookup)**:
   - **Description**: Accessing an element by its index (e.g., `arr[i]` in most programming languages).
   - **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** (constant time).
     - This is because arrays allow direct access to elements using their indices. The address of any element can be computed in constant time using the base address and the element's index.

### 2. **Search (Value Lookup)**:
   - **Description**: Searching for a specific value in the array.
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - **Unsorted Array**: **O(n)** (linear search).
       - In the worst case, you may have to check every element to find the target or determine it doesn't exist.
     - **Sorted Array**:
       - **Binary Search**: **O(log n)** (if the array is sorted and you're using a binary search).
         - Binary search repeatedly halves the array and narrows down the search range.
       - **Linear Search**: **O(n)** (if you're doing a basic linear search).

### Summary:
- **Index Lookup**: O(1)
- **Value Lookup**:
  - **Unsorted Array**: O(n)
  - **Sorted Array (Binary Search)**: O(log n)

To solve this problem, we can use Python sets to efficiently find the distinct integers present in one list but not in the other. Here's the implementation:

### **Python Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifference(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Convert nums1 and nums2 to sets to remove duplicates and enable set operations
        set1 = set(nums1)
        set2 = set(nums2)

        # Find elements in set1 not in set2 and vice versa
        diff1 = list(set1 - set2)
        diff2 = list(set2 - set1)

        # Return the result as a list of two lists
        return [diff1, diff2]
```

---

### **Explanation**

1. **Convert to Sets**:
   - Convert `nums1` and `nums2` into sets `set1` and `set2` to remove duplicates and allow efficient set operations.

2. **Find Differences**:
   - `set1 - set2`: Elements in `set1` that are not in `set2`.
   - `set2 - set1`: Elements in `set2` that are not in `set1`.

3. **Convert Back to List**:
   - Convert the resulting sets back to lists as required by the output format.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the differences as a list of two lists: `[diff1, diff2]`.

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**:
  - \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. Converting to sets and performing set operations are linear in complexity.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - \(O(n + m)\) for storing the sets.

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:
Input:
```python
nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
nums2 = [2, 4, 6]
```

Execution:
- `set1 = {1, 2, 3}`
- `set2 = {2, 4, 6}`
- `diff1 = [1, 3]` (elements in `set1` but not in `set2`)
- `diff2 = [4, 6]` (elements in `set2` but not in `set1`)
Output:
```python
[[1, 3], [4, 6]]
```

#### Example 2:
Input:
```python
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 3]
nums2 = [1, 1, 2, 2]
```

Execution:
- `set1 = {1, 2, 3}`
- `set2 = {1, 2}`
- `diff1 = [3]`
- `diff2 = []`
Output:
```python
[[3], []]
```

This implementation efficiently finds the required differences and meets the problem's constraints.

To determine if two strings are **close**, the following checks are necessary:

### **Key Observations**
1. **Same Character Set**:
   - Both strings must contain the same set of characters. If one string contains a character that the other does not, they cannot be transformed into each other.

2. **Character Frequencies**:
   - The frequency distribution of characters must be the same, even if the characters are in different orders. For example, `"cabbba"` and `"abbccc"` are close because the frequencies of characters (`[2, 3, 1]`) can be reordered to match each other.

3. **Operations**:
   - Operation 1 allows swapping of characters, so the order of characters is irrelevant.
   - Operation 2 allows transforming one character into another, so the frequencies of characters matter.

### **Algorithm**
1. Check if the sets of characters in `word1` and `word2` are the same. If not, return `False`.
2. Count the frequencies of characters in `word1` and `word2`.
3. Compare the sorted frequency distributions of both strings. If they match, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Check if the sets of characters are the same
        if set(word1) != set(word2):
            return False

        # Step 2: Count the frequency of characters in both strings
        freq1 = Counter(word1)
        freq2 = Counter(word2)

        # Step 3: Check if the sorted frequency distributions match
        return sorted(freq1.values()) == sorted(freq2.values())
```

### **Explanation of Steps**

#### Example 1:
```python
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "bca"
```
1. **Character Sets**: `set(word1) == set(word2)` → `{a, b, c} == {a, b, c}` → Pass.
2. **Character Frequencies**:
   - `freq1 = Counter({'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1})`
   - `freq2 = Counter({'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'a': 1})`
3. **Sorted Frequencies**:
   - `sorted(freq1.values()) == sorted(freq2.values())` → `[1, 1, 1] == [1, 1, 1]` → Pass.
4. **Result**: `True`.

#### Example 2:
```python
word1 = "a"
word2 = "aa"
```
1. **Character Sets**: `set(word1) != set(word2)` → `{a} != {a}` → Fail.
2. **Result**: `False`.

#### Example 3:
```python
word1 = "cabbba"
word2 = "abbccc"
```
1. **Character Sets**: `set(word1) == set(word2)` → `{a, b, c} == {a, b, c}` → Pass.
2. **Character Frequencies**:
   - `freq1 = Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})`
   - `freq2 = Counter({'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1})`
3. **Sorted Frequencies**:
   - `sorted(freq1.values()) == sorted(freq2.values())` → `[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]` → Pass.
4. **Result**: `True`.

### **Complexity Analysis**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Building character sets and frequency counts takes \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.
   - Sorting the frequency values takes \(O(u \log u)\), where \(u\) is the unique character count (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).
   - Overall: \(O(n + m + u \log u)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Storage for frequency counts and character sets: \(O(u)\), where \(u\) is the unique character count.
   - Overall: \(O(u)\).

This implementation is efficient and works well within the given constraints.

If we don't use `Counter`, we can manually count the frequencies of characters in the strings using arrays (or dictionaries). This approach is straightforward because the input consists of lowercase English letters only, which allows us to use a fixed-size array of size 26 for counting.

### **Algorithm Without `Counter`**
1. Use an array of size 26 to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. Check if the character sets of the two strings are identical.
3. Compare the sorted frequency arrays to determine if the frequency distributions are the same.

### **Python Implementation**
```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: If lengths are different, return False
        if len(word1) != len(word2):
            return False

        # Step 2: Count character frequencies manually
        freq1 = [0] * 26  # Frequency for word1
        freq2 = [0] * 26  # Frequency for word2
        for char in word1:
            freq1[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
        for char in word2:
            freq2[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

        # Step 3: Check if both words have the same character set
        for i in range(26):
            if (freq1[i] > 0 and freq2[i] == 0) or (freq2[i] > 0 and freq1[i] == 0):
                return False

        # Step 4: Compare the sorted frequencies
        return sorted(freq1) == sorted(freq2)
```

   - `freq2 = [1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0]` (1 'a', 1 'b', 1 'c')
3. **Character Set Check**: Frequencies align (no mismatch for nonzero values).
4. **Sorted Frequencies**:
   - `sorted(freq1) == sorted(freq2)` → `[1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0] == [1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0]` → Pass.

### **Complexity Analysis**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Counting frequencies: \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.
   - Checking the character set: \(O(26) = O(1)\) (constant for lowercase letters).
   - Sorting frequencies: \(O(26 \log 26) = O(1)\).
   - Overall: \(O(n + m)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Storage for frequency arrays: \(O(26 + 26) = O(1)\).
   - Overall: \(O(1)\).

This implementation is efficient and avoids the use of additional libraries like `collections.Counter`.

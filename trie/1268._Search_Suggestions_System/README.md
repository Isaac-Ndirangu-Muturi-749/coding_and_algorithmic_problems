To solve this problem, we can use a **Trie (prefix tree)** data structure to efficiently store and retrieve products based on their prefixes. After constructing the Trie, we traverse it character by character for the `searchWord`, collecting suggestions with each step. The suggestions are determined by lexicographical order, and we limit the output to at most three products.

---

### **Approach**

1. **Sort the Products**:
   - Sort the `products` array lexicographically to ensure suggestions are in the correct order.

2. **Construct the Trie**:
   - Insert each product into the Trie. Each node in the Trie will store up to three suggestions.

3. **Retrieve Suggestions**:
   - For each character in `searchWord`, traverse the Trie to find the matching prefix and gather the suggestions for that prefix.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no products match the prefix of `searchWord` at any point, append an empty list for that step.

---

### **Algorithm**

#### Trie Implementation:
- **TrieNode**: Each node will store:
  - A dictionary for child nodes (`children`).
  - A list of suggestions (`suggestions`) containing up to 3 products.

- **Trie**: The Trie supports:
  - `insert(product)`: Inserts a product into the Trie, updating suggestions for each node on the path.
  - `search(prefix)`: Retrieves suggestions for a given prefix.

---

### **Implementation**

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.suggestions = []

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, product):
        node = self.root
        for char in product:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
            # Add product to the suggestions if less than 3
            if len(node.suggestions) < 3:
                node.suggestions.append(product)

    def search(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        result = []
        for char in prefix:
            if char in node.children:
                node = node.children[char]
                result.append(node.suggestions)
            else:
                # No matching prefix found, append empty lists
                result.extend([[]] * (len(prefix) - len(result)))
                break
        return result

def suggestedProducts(products, searchWord):
    # Step 1: Sort products lexicographically
    products.sort()

    # Step 2: Build the Trie and insert all products
    trie = Trie()
    for product in products:
        trie.insert(product)

    # Step 3: Retrieve suggestions for each prefix of searchWord
    return trie.search(searchWord)
```

### **Complexity Analysis**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - **Sorting Products**: \(O(P \cdot \log P)\), where \(P\) is the number of products.
   - **Building the Trie**: \(O(P \cdot L)\), where \(L\) is the average length of the product names.
   - **Searching for Suggestions**: \(O(S \cdot L)\), where \(S\) is the length of `searchWord`.
   - Overall: \(O(P \cdot \log P + P \cdot L + S \cdot L)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Trie storage: \(O(P \cdot L)\) for the Trie structure.
   - Result storage: \(O(S \cdot 3)\) for the suggestions list.

---

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:
**Input**:
```python
products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
```

**Output**:
```python
[
 ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
 ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
 ["mouse","mousepad"],
 ["mouse","mousepad"],
 ["mouse","mousepad"]
]
```

#### Example 2:
**Input**:
```python
products = ["havana"]
searchWord = "havana"
```

**Output**:
```python
[["havana"], ["havana"], ["havana"], ["havana"], ["havana"], ["havana"]]
```

---

This approach ensures an efficient solution that scales well with the input size while maintaining correctness for all constraints.


Let's break down this code snippet:

```python
else:
    # No matching prefix found, append empty lists
    result.extend([[]] * (len(prefix) - len(result)))
    break
```

---

### **What the Code Does**
1. **Context**:
   - This code likely comes from a function that is processing some kind of "prefix" and trying to match it against something, storing results in the `result` list.

2. **When this Block is Triggered**:
   - The `else` block executes when no matching prefix is found in the current iteration or processing logic.

3. **Purpose**:
   - If no match is found, the code ensures that the `result` list is extended with empty lists to maintain proper alignment or length.

---

### **Detailed Explanation**
1. **Condition**:
   - The logic assumes that `prefix` has a certain length, and `result` needs to align with it.
   - If `len(prefix) > len(result)`, the code pads `result` with empty lists to match the length of `prefix`.

2. **How Padding is Done**:
   - `[[]]` creates an empty list.
   - `[[]] * (len(prefix) - len(result))` creates a list containing empty lists, repeated enough times to match the length difference between `prefix` and `result`.
   - `result.extend([...])` appends these empty lists to `result`.

3. **`break` Statement**:
   - The `break` ensures that the current processing stops since no further matching is needed.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
Let’s say:

#### Input:
```python
prefix = ["pre1", "pre2", "pre3"]
result = [["match1"], ["match2"]]
```

#### Execution:
- The length of `prefix` is 3.
- The length of `result` is 2.
- There's a mismatch (or no match found), so this block executes.

#### Code Action:
1. Calculate the difference in lengths: `len(prefix) - len(result) = 3 - 2 = 1`.
2. Create padding: `[[]] * 1 = [[]]`.
3. Extend `result`:
   - `result = [["match1"], ["match2"]] + [[]]`.
   - Final `result = [["match1"], ["match2"], []]`.

4. The `break` statement stops further processing.

---

### **Why is this Needed?**
- The function might need `result` to align with the `prefix` in length, where each entry in `result` corresponds to an entry in `prefix`.
- If no match exists for certain prefixes, the function fills those entries in `result` with empty lists to preserve structure.

---

### **Summary**
This block ensures that when a prefix has no matches:
1. The `result` list is padded with empty lists so its length matches `prefix`.
2. Processing stops immediately after padding using `break`.


Yes, there are alternatives depending on what you're trying to achieve. Here are some possibilities for handling the situation where no matching prefix is found:

---

### **Alternative 1: Pre-fill `result` with Empty Lists**
Instead of appending empty lists dynamically when no matches are found, you can pre-fill `result` to match the length of `prefix`. This avoids the need for dynamic adjustments.

```python
# Pre-fill result with empty lists
result = [[] for _ in range(len(prefix))]

# Populate only the matching entries
for i, pre in enumerate(prefix):
    if condition_for_match(pre):
        result[i] = get_matching_data(pre)
```

#### How It Works:
- `result` is pre-initialized with the same length as `prefix`, filled with empty lists.
- Only the indices corresponding to matches are updated, while unmatched entries remain as empty lists.

---

### **Alternative 2: Use a Default Dictionary**
You could use a dictionary (or `collections.defaultdict`) to store results for each prefix. If no match is found for a prefix, the value is simply an empty list.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

result_dict = defaultdict(list)

for pre in prefix:
    if condition_for_match(pre):
        result_dict[pre] = get_matching_data(pre)

# Convert to a list if needed
result = [result_dict[pre] for pre in prefix]
```

#### How It Works:
- A `defaultdict` ensures that any unmatched prefix automatically maps to an empty list.
- At the end, you can transform it into a list aligned with `prefix`.

---

### **Alternative 3: Use `None` for Unmatched Prefixes**
If you want to explicitly indicate unmatched prefixes without using empty lists, you can append `None` for clarity.

```python
for pre in prefix:
    if condition_for_match(pre):
        result.append(get_matching_data(pre))
    else:
        result.append(None)
```

#### How It Works:
- Appends `None` instead of `[]` to indicate no match.
- This can make it clearer in the output that certain prefixes had no matches.

---

### **Alternative 4: Combine Matching and Padding Later**
Instead of appending empty lists during the loop, first collect only matches in a separate list and then pad `result` to match `prefix`.

```python
result = []

for pre in prefix:
    if condition_for_match(pre):
        result.append(get_matching_data(pre))
    else:
        result.append([])

# Or pad later:
result.extend([[]] * (len(prefix) - len(result)))
```

#### How It Works:
- Matches are collected during iteration.
- Padding is applied in bulk at the end, if needed.

---

### **Key Considerations for Choosing an Alternative**
- **Performance:** Pre-filling or bulk padding is more efficient than appending during iteration.
- **Readability:** Using `None` or `defaultdict` may make your code easier to understand.
- **Flexibility:** Using a dictionary allows for more flexibility if `prefix` entries are not guaranteed to be unique or sequential.

Here’s how to solve the **Search Suggestions System** problem:

### **Problem Explanation**
- **Input**:
  - `products` (list of strings): Names of the products.
  - `searchWord` (string): A search query typed character by character.
- **Output**:
  - A list of lists where each inner list contains up to three lexicographically smallest products starting with the prefix formed after typing each character of `searchWord`.

### **Plan**
1. **Sort the Products**:
   - Sorting ensures that the results are already lexicographically ordered.
2. **Iterate Through `searchWord`**:
   - For each character in `searchWord`, filter products that start with the current prefix.
3. **Limit the Results**:
   - From the filtered list, take at most three items.
4. **Store the Results**:
   - Append the filtered list to the final result for each character.

### **Code Implementation**
Here’s the Python solution:

```python
def suggestedProducts(products, searchWord):
    # Sort the products lexicographically
    products.sort()

    result = []  # To store the results for each character
    prefix = ""  # Tracks the current prefix as we iterate through searchWord

    for char in searchWord:
        prefix += char  # Add the current character to the prefix
        # Filter products that start with the current prefix
        filtered = [product for product in products if product.startswith(prefix)]
        # Append at most 3 lexicographically smallest products
        result.append(filtered[:3])

    return result

# Example Usage
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
output = suggestedProducts(products, searchWord)
print(output)
```

### **Example Input/Output**
#### Input:
```python
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
```

#### Output:
```python
[
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"]
]
```

### **Explanation**
1. After typing `m`: Matches are `["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"]`.
2. After typing `mo`: Matches are still `["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"]`.
3. After typing `mou`: Matches reduce to `["mouse", "mousepad"]`.
4. After typing `mous`: Matches remain `["mouse", "mousepad"]`.
5. After typing `mouse`: Matches are still `["mouse", "mousepad"]`.

### **Optimizations**
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Instead of filtering with `startswith`, use binary search for faster prefix matching.
   - This is efficient when the size of `products` is large.

Would you like the optimized version with binary search?


Here’s an optimized solution using **binary search** for faster prefix matching:

### **Approach**
1. **Sort the `products`**:
   - Ensures that binary search works correctly.
2. **Binary Search for Prefix Matching**:
   - Use the prefix to locate the starting point of matching products.
3. **Iterate Through `searchWord`**:
   - For each prefix formed by typing a character, use binary search to find the relevant products.
4. **Limit Results**:
   - Collect at most three lexicographically smallest products for each prefix.

### **Code Implementation**
```python
import bisect

def suggestedProducts(products, searchWord):
    # Sort the products lexicographically
    products.sort()
    result = []
    prefix = ""

    for char in searchWord:
        prefix += char  # Update the current prefix
        # Use binary search to find the starting index of prefix in products
        start = bisect.bisect_left(products, prefix)
        # Collect up to three products that match the prefix
        suggestions = []
        for i in range(start, min(start + 3, len(products))):
            if products[i].startswith(prefix):
                suggestions.append(products[i])
            else:
                break
        result.append(suggestions)

    return result

# Example Usage
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
output = suggestedProducts(products, searchWord)
print(output)
```

### **How It Works**
1. **Sorting**:
   - Products are sorted lexicographically.
   - Example: `["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad"]`.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - `bisect.bisect_left(products, prefix)` finds the first index where the prefix could match.
3. **Efficient Matching**:
   - Start from the index found by binary search and collect at most three products that match the prefix.

### **Example Input/Output**
#### Input:
```python
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
```

#### Output:
```python
[
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"]
]
```

### **Explanation**
- After sorting, `products = ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad"]`.
- Binary search ensures that we only consider the relevant portion of the list, minimizing unnecessary comparisons.

### **Time Complexity**
1. **Sorting**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of products.
2. **Binary Search**: \(O(M \cdot \log N)\), where \(M\) is the length of `searchWord`.
3. **Total**: \(O(N \log N + M \cdot \log N)\).

This approach is more efficient for large datasets.


If you want to implement the same functionality without using the `bisect` module, you can manually perform binary search using a helper function. Here’s how you can do it:

### **Approach**
1. **Sort the `products` list** (lexicographically).
2. **Implement a Custom Binary Search**:
   - Find the starting index of the products that match the prefix.
3. **Iterate Through `searchWord`**:
   - Use the prefix to locate the starting index using binary search.
   - Collect up to three matching products for each prefix.

### **Code Implementation**
```python
def binary_search_start(products, prefix):
    # Custom binary search to find the first product that starts with the prefix
    left, right = 0, len(products)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if products[mid] < prefix:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

def suggestedProducts(products, searchWord):
    # Sort the products lexicographically
    products.sort()
    result = []
    prefix = ""

    for char in searchWord:
        prefix += char  # Update the current prefix
        # Find the start index of the prefix using custom binary search
        start = binary_search_start(products, prefix)
        # Collect up to three products that match the prefix
        suggestions = []
        for i in range(start, min(start + 3, len(products))):
            if products[i].startswith(prefix):
                suggestions.append(products[i])
            else:
                break
        result.append(suggestions)

    return result

# Example Usage
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
output = suggestedProducts(products, searchWord)
print(output)
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Custom Binary Search (`binary_search_start`)**:
   - Finds the smallest index of a product that starts with the prefix.
   - Compares the prefix with the middle element of the current search range.
   - Adjusts `left` and `right` pointers based on the comparison.
2. **Iterating Through `searchWord`**:
   - Build the prefix character by character.
   - Use the custom binary search to find the starting index of matching products.
   - Collect up to three matching products.

### **Example Input/Output**
#### Input:
```python
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
```

#### Output:
```python
[
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"],
 ["mouse", "mousepad"]
]
```

### **How It Works**
1. After sorting:
   - `products = ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad"]`.
2. Custom binary search ensures that only relevant parts of the list are checked for the prefix.

### **Time Complexity**
1. **Sorting**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of products.
2. **Custom Binary Search**: \(O(M \cdot \log N)\), where \(M\) is the length of `searchWord`.
3. **Total**: \(O(N \log N + M \cdot \log N)\).

This solution avoids using the `bisect` module while retaining the efficiency of binary search.

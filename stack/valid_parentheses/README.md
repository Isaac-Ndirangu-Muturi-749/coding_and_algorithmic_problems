To determine if a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'` is valid, we can use a stack data structure. The idea is to push each opening bracket onto the stack and pop it off when a matching closing bracket is encountered. If we can successfully match all brackets in the correct order, the string is valid.

### Steps:

1. **Use a Stack**:
   - Traverse through each character in the string.
   - Push each opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`) onto the stack.
   - When encountering a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), check if the top of the stack has the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, pop the stack. If it doesn't, the string is invalid.

2. **Check Stack at the End**:
   - After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the string is valid. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets.

### Code Implementation:

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
        stack = []
        # Dictionary to match corresponding opening and closing brackets
        bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}

        for char in s:
            if char in bracket_map:
                # Pop the topmost element if it matches the corresponding opening bracket
                top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
                if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                    return False
            else:
                # Push opening bracket onto stack
                stack.append(char)

        # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
        return not stack
```

### Explanation:

1. **Stack Initialization**:
   - We use a list `stack` to simulate stack operations (push and pop).
   - A dictionary `bracket_map` is used to store the matching pairs of brackets.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character in the string `s`, if the character is a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack contains the matching opening bracket.
   - If it does, we pop the stack. If not, or if the stack is empty, the string is invalid.
   - If the character is an opening bracket, it is simply pushed onto the stack.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing the string, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all brackets were matched correctly.

### Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - **Input**: `"()"`
   - **Output**: `True`
   - **Explanation**: The string is valid because the only pair of brackets matches.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: `"()[]{}"`
   - **Output**: `True`
   - **Explanation**: All pairs of brackets are matched in the correct order.

3. **Example 3**:
   - **Input**: `"(]"`
   - **Output**: `False`
   - **Explanation**: The string is invalid because the first bracket is `(` but is closed by `]`.

4. **Example 4**:
   - **Input**: `"([])"`
   - **Output**: `True`
   - **Explanation**: The string is valid as all brackets are matched correctly in the correct order.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, all characters in the string could be opening brackets.

This solution efficiently checks the validity of a string of brackets using a stack, ensuring that all conditions are met for the string to be valid.

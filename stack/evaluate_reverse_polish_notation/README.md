To solve this problem, we can use a **stack** to evaluate the expression in **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**. The stack helps to keep track of operands and allows us to process each operator as we encounter it.

### Key Idea:
- **Reverse Polish Notation** evaluates expressions without parentheses. The operators come after their operands.
- When we encounter an operand (a number), we push it onto the stack.
- When we encounter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), we pop the top two numbers from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize a stack** to store the numbers.
2. **Iterate through each token** in the input:
   - If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator:
     - Pop the top two numbers from the stack.
     - Apply the operator to these two numbers in the correct order (remember the second popped number is the left operand and the first popped number is the right operand).
     - Push the result back onto the stack.
3. After processing all tokens, the result will be the only number left in the stack. Return this number.

### Python Code:

```python
def evalRPN(tokens):
    stack = []

    for token in tokens:
        if token in "+-*/":
            # Pop two numbers from the stack
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()

            # Perform the operation
            if token == '+':
                result = a + b
            elif token == '-':
                result = a - b
            elif token == '*':
                result = a * b
            elif token == '/':
                # Perform integer division with truncation toward zero
                result = int(a / b)

            # Push the result back onto the stack
            stack.append(result)
        else:
            # If it's a number, convert it to an integer and push it to the stack
            stack.append(int(token))

    # The final result will be the only item left in the stack
    return stack[0]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Stack**: We use a stack to store operands as we encounter them.
2. **Operators**: When we encounter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), we pop the top two elements from the stack and apply the operator. The result is pushed back to the stack.
   - Division (`/`) is handled carefully using `int(a / b)` to ensure it truncates toward zero.
3. **Final Result**: Once all tokens have been processed, the stack will contain exactly one element, which is the result of the expression.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`
- Push `2` onto the stack.
- Push `1` onto the stack.
- Encounter `+`, pop `2` and `1`, compute `2 + 1 = 3`, push `3` onto the stack.
- Push `3` onto the stack.
- Encounter `*`, pop `3` and `3`, compute `3 * 3 = 9`, push `9` onto the stack.
- Final result: `9`

#### Example 2:
Input: `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`
- Push `4` onto the stack.
- Push `13` onto the stack.
- Push `5` onto the stack.
- Encounter `/`, pop `13` and `5`, compute `13 / 5 = 2` (integer division), push `2` onto the stack.
- Encounter `+`, pop `4` and `2`, compute `4 + 2 = 6`, push `6` onto the stack.
- Final result: `6`

#### Example 3:
Input: `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`
- The result of processing all these operations step by step results in the final output `22`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input `tokens`. We process each token exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), because in the worst case, all tokens are numbers, and we will store them all on the stack.

This approach efficiently evaluates Reverse Polish Notation expressions in linear time.


**Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**, also known as **postfix notation**, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to define the order of operations as required in infix notation (the standard notation most people are familiar with, where operators are between operands).

### Example:
In standard infix notation, you might write an expression like:
```
3 + 4
```
In reverse Polish notation (RPN), this same expression would be written as:
```
3 4 +
```
The operator `+` comes **after** the operands `3` and `4`.

### How RPN Works:
In RPN, you write expressions by listing the operands first, followed by the operators. Since RPN doesn’t require parentheses to indicate precedence, the order of operations is simply determined by the position of the operator in relation to its operands.

### Example:
Consider the expression `(3 + 4) * 5` in infix notation. In reverse Polish notation, it becomes:
```
3 4 + 5 *
```
This is how it works:
1. First, add `3` and `4` (because the `+` operator comes right after the `3 4`):
   - `3 4 +` evaluates to `7`.
2. Then multiply the result (`7`) by `5`:
   - `7 5 *` evaluates to `35`.

### Evaluation of RPN Expressions:
RPN is commonly evaluated using a **stack**. You process the expression from left to right:
1. When you encounter a **number**, you push it onto the stack.
2. When you encounter an **operator**, you pop the required number of operands (two for binary operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.

#### Example:
Let’s evaluate the RPN expression `5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -`:
1. Push `5` onto the stack.
2. Push `1` onto the stack.
3. Push `2` onto the stack.
4. The next token is `+`. Pop `1` and `2`, add them (`1 + 2 = 3`), and push the result (`3`).
   - Stack now: `[5, 3]`.
5. Push `4` onto the stack.
6. The next token is `*`. Pop `3` and `4`, multiply them (`3 * 4 = 12`), and push the result (`12`).
   - Stack now: `[5, 12]`.
7. The next token is `+`. Pop `5` and `12`, add them (`5 + 12 = 17`), and push the result (`17`).
   - Stack now: `[17]`.
8. Push `3` onto the stack.
9. The next token is `-`. Pop `17` and `3`, subtract them (`17 - 3 = 14`), and push the result (`14`).

The final result is `14`.

### Advantages of RPN:
1. **No need for parentheses**: Since the order of operations is implicitly determined by the order of operators and operands, parentheses are not necessary.
2. **Efficient computation**: RPN is easy to evaluate using a stack, making it popular in calculators and computer programming.
3. **Fewer rules**: RPN has a simpler syntax than infix notation, which requires understanding operator precedence and parentheses.

### Summary:
- **RPN** is a postfix notation where operators follow operands, avoiding the need for parentheses.
- It is evaluated using a **stack**, processing operands and operators in the order they appear.
- It simplifies the parsing of expressions and is commonly used in calculators and stack-based programming languages.

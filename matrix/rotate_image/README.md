To rotate a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise **in-place**, we can break the problem into two steps:

1. **Transpose the matrix**: Convert rows into columns.
2. **Reverse each row**: After transposing, reverse each row to get the final rotated matrix.

### Approach:

#### Step 1: Transpose the matrix
- Transposing a matrix involves swapping `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` for all `i` and `j` where `i < j`. This step effectively converts rows into columns.

#### Step 2: Reverse each row
- Once the matrix is transposed, reversing each row will give the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)

        # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

        # Step 2: Reverse each row
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i].reverse()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transpose the matrix**:
   - We loop over the matrix and swap `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` for all `i` and `j` such that `i < j`. This ensures that rows are converted into columns.

2. **Reverse each row**:
   - After transposing, each row is reversed. This effectively shifts all elements to the right positions for a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
matrix = [[1,2,3],
          [4,5,6],
          [7,8,9]]

# Step 1: Transpose the matrix
[[1,4,7],
 [2,5,8],
 [3,6,9]]

# Step 2: Reverse each row
[[7,4,1],
 [8,5,2],
 [9,6,3]]
```

#### Example 2:
```python
matrix = [[5,1,9,11],
          [2,4,8,10],
          [13,3,6,7],
          [15,14,12,16]]

# Step 1: Transpose the matrix
[[5,2,13,15],
 [1,4,3,14],
 [9,8,6,12],
 [11,10,7,16]]

# Step 2: Reverse each row
[[15,13,2,5],
 [14,3,4,1],
 [12,6,8,9],
 [16,7,10,11]]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: We iterate over each element of the matrix once to transpose it, and then we iterate over each row to reverse it. This gives a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the number of rows or columns in the matrix.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The matrix is modified in-place, so no additional space is used apart from a few temporary variables for swapping.

This solution efficiently rotates the matrix in-place without using extra space.


Using a **left, right, top, and bottom approach** is an alternative method to rotate the matrix in-place by rotating **layers** or **rings** of the matrix one by one. This approach involves treating the matrix as concentric squares (layers), where we rotate the four sides of each layer.

For a 90-degree clockwise rotation, we can follow this procedure:

1. Start from the outermost layer (top-left to bottom-right) and rotate elements in groups of four:
   - Move the **top** element to the **right**.
   - Move the **right** element to the **bottom**.
   - Move the **bottom** element to the **left**.
   - Move the **left** element to the **top**.

2. Repeat this process for each layer moving inwards, shrinking the boundaries of the square as you progress.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(matrix)

        # Rotate the matrix layer by layer
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        while left < right:
            for i in range(right - left):
                top, bottom = left, right

                # Save the top-left corner element
                topLeft = matrix[top][left + i]

                # Move bottom-left to top-left
                matrix[top][left + i] = matrix[bottom - i][left]

                # Move bottom-right to bottom-left
                matrix[bottom - i][left] = matrix[bottom][right - i]

                # Move top-right to bottom-right
                matrix[bottom][right - i] = matrix[top + i][right]

                # Move top-left to top-right
                matrix[top + i][right] = topLeft

            # Move to the inner layer
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

### Explanation:

1. **Layer-based rotation**:
   - We initialize the `left` and `right` pointers to represent the boundaries of the current layer we are rotating. `left` starts at `0` and `right` starts at `n - 1` (where `n` is the size of the matrix).
   - For each layer, we move elements in a group of four in a circular manner.

2. **Rotating four elements at a time**:
   - For each element in the current layer, starting from `i = 0` to `i = right - left`:
     - The element in the **top-left** corner is temporarily stored.
     - The **bottom-left** element is moved to the **top-left**.
     - The **bottom-right** element is moved to the **bottom-left**.
     - The **top-right** element is moved to the **bottom-right**.
     - The **top-left** element is moved to the **top-right**.

3. **Iterating over layers**:
   - Once the outermost layer is rotated, the boundaries are moved inward (`left += 1`, `right -= 1`) and the process repeats for the next inner layer until all layers are rotated.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
matrix = [[1,2,3],
          [4,5,6],
          [7,8,9]]

# After rotating layer by layer:

[[7,4,1],
 [8,5,2],
 [9,6,3]]
```

- **First layer (left=0, right=2)**:
  - Save top-left `1`, move bottom-left `7` to top-left.
  - Move bottom-right `9` to bottom-left.
  - Move top-right `3` to bottom-right.
  - Move saved `1` to top-right.

#### Example 2:
```python
matrix = [[5,1,9,11],
          [2,4,8,10],
          [13,3,6,7],
          [15,14,12,16]]

# After rotating layer by layer:

[[15,13,2,5],
 [14,3,4,1],
 [12,6,8,9],
 [16,7,10,11]]
```

- **First layer (left=0, right=3)**:
  - Rotate elements in the outermost square.
- **Second layer (left=1, right=2)**:
  - Rotate the inner 2x2 square.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: We still visit every element once. Each layer involves moving `O(n)` elements, and there are `O(n)` layers to rotate, where `n` is the size of the matrix.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: This approach uses only constant extra space since it rotates elements in-place without allocating extra arrays.

### Summary:

The **left, right, top, bottom approach** effectively rotates the matrix layer by layer, moving four elements at a time in a circular manner. This in-place method ensures that the rotation is done in constant extra space.


This piece of code performs an **in-place transpose** of a square matrix (i.e., a matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns). Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial Setup:
- `n` represents the size of the square matrix, meaning it has `n` rows and `n` columns. For example, for a 3x3 matrix, `n = 3`.

### Code Breakdown:

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
```

#### Outer loop (`for i in range(n)`):
- The outer loop iterates over the rows of the matrix. Here, `i` is the row index.
- `i` will take values from `0` to `n - 1` (i.e., it loops over all rows).

#### Inner loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`):
- The inner loop iterates over the columns of the matrix, but it starts from `i + 1` (i.e., `j = i + 1`) rather than from `0`. This ensures that the loop only swaps elements **above the diagonal** of the matrix.
- `j` will take values from `i + 1` to `n - 1` (i.e., it loops over the columns that are ahead of the current row, skipping the diagonal).

#### Swapping:
```python
matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
```
- This line swaps the elements `matrix[i][j]` (an element above the diagonal) and `matrix[j][i]` (an element below the diagonal).
- This swap effectively **transposes** the matrix in place by exchanging the row and column indices of these elements.

### How It Works:

To understand this better, let’s look at an example with a 3x3 matrix:

#### Original Matrix:
```
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

- **Outer loop (i = 0):**
  - **Inner loop (j = 1):** Swap `matrix[0][1]` and `matrix[1][0]`.
    - Swap `2` and `4`. The matrix becomes:
      ```
      [
        [1, 4, 3],
        [2, 5, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
      ]
      ```
  - **Inner loop (j = 2):** Swap `matrix[0][2]` and `matrix[2][0]`.
    - Swap `3` and `7`. The matrix becomes:
      ```
      [
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 6],
        [3, 8, 9]
      ]
      ```

- **Outer loop (i = 1):**
  - **Inner loop (j = 2):** Swap `matrix[1][2]` and `matrix[2][1]`.
    - Swap `6` and `8`. The matrix becomes:
      ```
      [
        [1, 4, 7],
        [2, 5, 8],
        [3, 6, 9]
      ]
      ```

- **Outer loop (i = 2):**
  - The inner loop doesn’t run because `j = i + 1` would be `3`, which is beyond the matrix size (`n = 3`).

#### Final Matrix:
After completing these swaps, the matrix is fully transposed:

```
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]
```

### Key Points:

- **Diagonal elements** (`matrix[i][i]`) are not touched because the inner loop starts at `i + 1`. In this case, `1`, `5`, and `9` remain in place.
- This is an **in-place** operation, meaning the original matrix is modified directly, without using extra space.
- The result is the **transpose** of the original matrix, where the rows become columns and vice versa.

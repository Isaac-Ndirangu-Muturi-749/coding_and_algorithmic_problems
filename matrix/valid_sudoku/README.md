To determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid, we need to ensure that:

1. Each row contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.

### Approach:

We can approach this problem by using three sets:
- One set for rows to track the digits that have already been seen in each row.
- One set for columns to track the digits that have already been seen in each column.
- One set for 3x3 sub-boxes to track the digits that have already been seen in each box.

For each digit on the board:
1. Calculate which row, column, and 3x3 sub-box it belongs to.
2. Check if the digit has already been seen in the corresponding row, column, or sub-box. If it has, the board is invalid.
3. If it hasnâ€™t been seen, add it to the appropriate sets.

If the entire board is processed without finding any duplicates, the board is valid.

### Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: list[list[str]]) -> bool:
        # Create 9 empty sets for rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes
        rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]

        for i in range(9):  # Loop through each row
            for j in range(9):  # Loop through each column
                num = board[i][j]
                if num == '.':
                    continue  # Skip empty cells

                # Calculate the index for the 3x3 sub-box
                box_index = (i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)

                # Check if the number is already in the respective row, column, or box
                if num in rows[i]:
                    return False
                if num in cols[j]:
                    return False
                if num in boxes[box_index]:
                    return False

                # Add the number to the respective row, column, and box sets
                rows[i].add(num)
                cols[j].add(num)
                boxes[box_index].add(num)

        return True  # If no conflicts, the board is valid

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
board1 = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
         ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
         ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
         ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
         ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
         ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
         ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
         ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
         ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

board2 = [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
         ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
         ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
         ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
         ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
         ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]

         ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
         ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

print(solution.isValidSudoku(board1))  # Output: True
print(solution.isValidSudoku(board2))  # Output: False
```

### Explanation:
- **Board 1** is valid: No digit repeats in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-box.
- **Board 2** is invalid: The digit '8' repeats in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.

The solution efficiently checks each digit by using sets to track seen digits, ensuring that the board is valid according to Sudoku rules. The overall time complexity is O(1) because the board size is fixed at 9x9, so the operations are constant in scale.

Let's break down the `isValidSudoku` function step by step to understand how it checks if a given Sudoku board is valid.

### Problem Context:
- **Objective**: Determine if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. According to Sudoku rules:
  - Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  - Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
  - Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
- **Input**: A 9x9 grid represented as a list of lists, where each element is either a digit ('1'-'9') or an empty cell ('.').

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Initialization of Sets**:
    ```python
    rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    ```
   - Three lists of sets are initialized to track the digits present in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box.
   - Each set will be used to check if a digit has already appeared in a specific row, column, or sub-box.

2. **Iterate Through the Board**:
    ```python
    for i in range(9):  # Loop through each row
        for j in range(9):  # Loop through each column
    ```
   - The function uses nested loops to iterate through each cell of the board. The outer loop (`i`) iterates through the rows, and the inner loop (`j`) iterates through the columns.

3. **Skip Empty Cells**:
    ```python
    num = board[i][j]
    if num == '.':
        continue  # Skip empty cells
    ```
   - If a cell contains '.', it is empty, and the function skips it since it doesn't need to be checked.

4. **Determine Sub-Box Index**:
    ```python
    box_index = (i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)
    ```
   - The index of the 3x3 sub-box is calculated using the formula `(i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)`. This formula maps each cell to one of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes.
     - `i // 3` gives the row index of the sub-box.
     - `j // 3` gives the column index of the sub-box.
     - Multiplying by 3 and adding gives a unique index from 0 to 8 corresponding to the 9 sub-boxes.

5. **Validation Checks**:
    ```python
    if num in rows[i]:
        return False
    if num in cols[j]:
        return False
    if num in boxes[box_index]:
        return False
    ```
   - For each cell, the function checks if the digit `num` is already present in the corresponding row (`rows[i]`), column (`cols[j]`), or sub-box (`boxes[box_index]`).
   - If the digit is found in any of these, it means the board violates Sudoku rules, so the function returns `False`.

6. **Add Digit to Sets**:
    ```python
    rows[i].add(num)
    cols[j].add(num)
    boxes[box_index].add(num)
    ```
   - If the digit `num` is not found in the corresponding row, column, or sub-box, it is added to the appropriate sets, indicating that this digit has been encountered in that specific row, column, and sub-box.

7. **Return Validity**:
    ```python
    return True
    ```
   - If the entire board is processed without finding any violations of the rules, the function returns `True`, indicating that the Sudoku board is valid.

### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the following partial Sudoku board:

```
5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .
6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .
. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .
---------------------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
---------------------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
```

- As the function iterates through each cell:
  - For `i = 0`, `j = 0`, `num = 5`:
    - `box_index = 0`, it checks if `5` is already in `rows[0]`, `cols[0]`, or `boxes[0]`.
    - Since none of these contain `5`, it adds `5` to these sets.
  - This process continues for all digits on the board.
  - If any digit is found to violate the Sudoku rules (i.e., already exists in the corresponding row, column, or box), the function would return `False`.

### Final Thoughts:
This approach ensures that each digit in the Sudoku board is checked against the constraints of the game in a time-efficient manner, using O(1) operations per cell, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(81), which simplifies to O(1) due to the fixed size of the board.



The expression `[set() for _ in range(9)]` is a list comprehension that creates a list of 9 empty sets. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **`set()`**:
   - `set()` creates a new, empty set. A set is a collection of unique elements, meaning it does not allow duplicates.
   - In this context, each set will be used to store the digits encountered in a specific row, column, or 3x3 sub-box of the Sudoku board.

2. **`for _ in range(9)`**:
   - `range(9)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 numbers).
   - The underscore `_` is a common convention in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop. It simply indicates that something should be done 9 times.

3. **List Comprehension**:
   - The entire expression `[set() for _ in range(9)]` is a list comprehension, which is a compact way to generate a list in Python.
   - In this case, it generates a list with 9 elements, where each element is an empty set.

### Example Output:
If you were to print the result of `[set() for _ in range(9)]`, you would see something like this:

```python
[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]
```

### Usage in the `isValidSudoku` Function:
In the `isValidSudoku` function, this list of sets is used to track the numbers found in:
- **`rows[i]`**: A set tracking numbers in the `i-th` row.
- **`cols[j]`**: A set tracking numbers in the `j-th` column.
- **`boxes[box_index]`**: A set tracking numbers in the `box_index`-th 3x3 sub-box.

This setup allows the function to efficiently check whether a digit has already been encountered in the corresponding row, column, or sub-box, helping determine if the Sudoku board is valid.

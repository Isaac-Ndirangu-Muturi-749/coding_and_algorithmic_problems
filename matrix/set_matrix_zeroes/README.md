To solve the problem of setting entire rows and columns to zero when a cell in the matrix is `0`, we need an efficient approach that avoids using extra space beyond the input matrix. Here’s the step-by-step strategy to achieve that in place.

### Approach:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - If a cell at `matrix[i][j]` is `0`, then the entire row `i` and the entire column `j` should be set to `0`.
   - We need to do this in-place, so we can’t use extra space (beyond a constant amount). However, we can use the first row and first column of the matrix itself to store information about which rows and columns should be set to `0`.

2. **Steps**:
   - First, traverse the matrix to determine which rows and columns need to be set to `0`. You can use the first row to track which columns should be zeroed and the first column to track which rows should be zeroed.
   - Then, set the respective rows and columns to zero using the information stored in the first row and column.
   - Finally, if the first row or first column originally contained a `0`, those need to be zeroed as well.

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - To avoid accidentally modifying the first row and first column while we’re using them as markers, we need to keep track of whether the first row or first column should be zeroed separately.

### Detailed Steps:

1. Traverse the matrix and mark the first row and first column to indicate which rows and columns need to be zeroed.
2. Traverse the matrix again and set the cells to zero based on the markers in the first row and column.
3. Finally, handle the first row and first column separately, based on whether they originally had any zeros.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    first_row_zero = False
    first_col_zero = False

    # Step 1: Determine if the first row or first column needs to be zero
    for i in range(m):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0:
            first_col_zero = True
            break

    for j in range(n):
        if matrix[0][j] == 0:
            first_row_zero = True
            break

    # Step 2: Use first row and column as markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Step 3: Set the cells to zero based on the markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Step 4: Handle the first row and first column
    if first_col_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0

    if first_row_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
```

### Explanation:

1. **Step 1**: We check if the first row or the first column contains any `0`s. If it does, we set two flags: `first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero`. These flags help us remember whether we need to zero out the first row or the first column later.

2. **Step 2**: For each cell in the matrix, if the cell is `0`, we mark its row and column by setting `matrix[i][0] = 0` and `matrix[0][j] = 0`. This way, the first row and first column act as indicators for which rows and columns should be zeroed.

3. **Step 3**: We then use the information in the first row and first column to set the appropriate rows and columns to zero.

4. **Step 4**: Finally, if the `first_row_zero` or `first_col_zero` flags are `True`, we zero out the first row or column.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We traverse the matrix a few times, but each traversal is linear in terms of the number of elements in the matrix (m rows and n columns).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We only use a few additional variables (`first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero`), making the space complexity constant.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`

1. Check if the first row or first column contains zeros:
   - First row: `[1, 1, 1]` → No zeros.
   - First column: `[1, 1, 1]` → No zeros.

2. Traverse the rest of the matrix and mark rows and columns:
   - At `(1,1)`, we find a `0`, so we mark the first row and first column:
     ```
     matrix = [[1, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 1],
               [1, 1, 1]]
     ```

3. Zero out cells based on markers:
   - For `(1,1)` → already `0`.
   - For `(1,2)` → zero it out because the first row is marked.
   - For `(2,1)` → zero it out because the first column is marked.
     ```
     matrix = [[1, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 1]]
     ```

4. No need to zero out the first row or column, as the flags are `False`.

Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]`

1. Check first row/column:
   - First row: `[0, 1, 2, 0]` → Set `first_row_zero = True`.
   - First column: `[0, 3, 1]` → Set `first_col_zero = True`.

2. Traverse the rest of the matrix and mark rows and columns:
   ```
   matrix = [[0, 0, 2, 0],
             [0, 4, 5, 2],
             [1, 3, 1, 5]]
   ```

3. Zero out cells based on markers:
   ```
   matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 4, 5, 0],
             [0, 3, 1, 0]]
   ```

4. Zero out the first row and column:
   ```
   matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0]]
   ```

Output: `[[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]]`

This solution handles the problem efficiently while using constant extra space.



To solve the problem using constant space, we need to avoid allocating extra memory beyond the input matrix itself. Here's how we can achieve that:

### Approach:

We can use the **first row and first column of the matrix itself as markers** to indicate whether a particular row or column should be set to zero. The challenge here is to ensure we handle the first row and first column properly since they themselves are being used as storage.

Here's the step-by-step strategy to achieve an **O(1) space solution**:

1. **Determine if the first row and the first column should be zeroed**:
   - First, we scan the first row and first column separately to see if they contain any zeros.
   - This is important because if they need to be zeroed, we must handle them separately at the end.

2. **Use the first row and first column to mark other rows and columns**:
   - For every other cell in the matrix (i.e., cells not in the first row or column), if the cell is `0`, we mark its corresponding row and column by setting the first cell of that row and the first cell of that column to `0`.

3. **Zero out cells based on the markers in the first row and first column**:
   - After marking, traverse the matrix again and zero out cells based on the information in the first row and column.

4. **Handle the first row and first column separately**:
   - Finally, zero out the first row and the first column if needed, based on whether they originally contained any zeros.

### Detailed Steps and Code Implementation:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    first_row_zero = False
    first_col_zero = False

    # Step 1: Check if the first row and first column contain zeros
    for i in range(m):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0:
            first_col_zero = True
            break

    for j in range(n):
        if matrix[0][j] == 0:
            first_row_zero = True
            break

    # Step 2: Use the first row and column as markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Step 3: Zero out cells based on the markers in the first row and column
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Step 4: Handle the first row and first column separately
    if first_col_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0

    if first_row_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Row and Column Check**:
   - We first check if the first row or the first column contains any `0`. This is important because we'll be using them as markers, so we need to handle them separately later if they need to be zeroed.

2. **Marking Rows and Columns**:
   - For each cell in the matrix (excluding the first row and column), if a `0` is found at position `(i, j)`, we mark the corresponding row and column by setting `matrix[i][0] = 0` and `matrix[0][j] = 0`.
   - This allows us to store the information about which rows and columns should be zeroed in the first row and column of the matrix itself, thus avoiding the need for extra space.

3. **Zeroing Based on Markers**:
   - After marking, we traverse the matrix again. For each cell, if the marker for its row or column (i.e., the first cell in the row or the first cell in the column) is `0`, we set that cell to `0`.

4. **Zeroing the First Row and Column**:
   - Finally, based on the flags `first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero`, we zero out the first row or column if needed.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We traverse the matrix a few times, but each traversal is linear in terms of the number of elements in the matrix (m rows and n columns).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We are not using any extra space except for a few variables (`first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero`), so the space complexity is constant.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`

1. First row and first column:
   - First row: No zeros.
   - First column: No zeros.

2. Mark rows and columns:
   - At `(1,1)`, we find a `0`. Mark `matrix[1][0] = 0` and `matrix[0][1] = 0`.
     ```
     matrix = [[1, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 1],
               [1, 1, 1]]
     ```

3. Zero out cells:
   - Zero out all cells in row 1 and column 1 based on the markers in the first row and first column:
     ```
     matrix = [[1, 0, 1],
               [0, 0, 0],
               [1, 0, 1]]
     ```

4. Handle the first row and column: No need to zero out the first row or column.

Output: `[[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]`

1. First row and first column:
   - First row: Contains a `0` → Set `first_row_zero = True`.
   - First column: Contains a `0` → Set `first_col_zero = True`.

2. Mark rows and columns:
   - At `(1,3)`, mark column 3 → `matrix[0][3] = 0`.
   - At `(2,0)`, mark row 2 → `matrix[2][0] = 0`.

3. Zero out cells:
   ```
   matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 4, 5, 0],
             [0, 3, 1, 0]]
   ```

4. Handle first row and first column:
   ```
   matrix = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0, 0]]
   ```

Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`

This approach ensures that the solution runs in **O(1) space**, achieving optimal efficiency.




Here's a breakdown of three different approaches for solving the problem of setting matrix rows and columns to zero if any element is zero, based on space complexity:

1. **O(m * n) space solution (straightforward but inefficient)**
2. **O(m + n) space solution (an improvement)**
3. **O(1) space solution (optimal)**

### 1. O(m * n) Space Solution (Straightforward Approach)

In this approach, we use an auxiliary matrix (of the same size as the original matrix) to mark which rows and columns need to be set to zero.

#### Approach:
- Create a copy of the matrix.
- Traverse the matrix, and if any element is `0`, mark the corresponding row and column in the auxiliary matrix.
- Traverse the matrix again, and for each `0` in the auxiliary matrix, set the entire row and column in the original matrix to zero.

#### Code:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    copy = [[matrix[i][j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if copy[i][j] == 0:
                for k in range(n):
                    matrix[i][k] = 0
                for k in range(m):
                    matrix[k][j] = 0
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: We use a separate matrix of the same size as the input matrix.

### 2. O(m + n) Space Solution (Improvement)

In this approach, instead of using a full auxiliary matrix, we use two arrays: one to track which rows should be set to zero, and another to track which columns should be set to zero.

#### Approach:
- Create two arrays, `rows` and `cols`, to track which rows and columns need to be zeroed out.
- Traverse the matrix once, and if any element is `0`, mark the corresponding row and column.
- Traverse the matrix again, and for each element, if its row or column is marked in `rows` or `cols`, set it to `0`.

#### Code:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    rows = [False] * m
    cols = [False] * n

    # First pass to mark the rows and columns that need to be zeroed
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                rows[i] = True
                cols[j] = True

    # Second pass to set zeros in rows and columns
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if rows[i] or cols[j]:
                matrix[i][j] = 0
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(m + n)**: We use two arrays, one for rows and one for columns.

### 3. O(1) Space Solution (Optimal Approach)

In this optimal approach, we use the first row and first column of the matrix itself as markers, avoiding any extra space allocation beyond a few constant variables.

#### Approach:
1. **Check the first row and first column** to determine if they need to be zeroed out at the end.
2. Use the first row and first column to store markers for the rest of the matrix. If any element in the matrix is zero, mark the corresponding row and column by setting the first cell of that row and the first cell of that column to zero.
3. **Zero out the marked rows and columns** based on the markers in the first row and first column.
4. **Zero out the first row and first column** if needed, based on the initial check.

#### Code:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> None:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    first_row_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n))
    first_col_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))

    # Use first row and first column as markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Zero out rows based on markers
    for i in range(1, m):
        if matrix[i][0] == 0:
            for j in range(1, n):
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Zero out columns based on markers
    for j in range(1, n):
        if matrix[0][j] == 0:
            for i in range(1, m):
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Handle the first row
    if first_row_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0

    # Handle the first column
    if first_col_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0
```

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: We use only a few constant variables (`first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero`) in addition to the matrix itself.

### Summary:
- **O(m * n) Space**: The straightforward approach uses an auxiliary matrix of size `m * n`.
- **O(m + n) Space**: The improved approach uses arrays of size `m` and `n` to track rows and columns.
- **O(1) Space**: The optimal approach uses the matrix itself as storage for markers and handles the first row and column separately. This is the most efficient solution in terms of space complexity.

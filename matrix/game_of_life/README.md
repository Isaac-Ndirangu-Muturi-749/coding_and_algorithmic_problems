### Game of Life Overview:
The "Game of Life" simulates a board of cells that can be either alive (1) or dead (0), with the following rules applied to each cell at the same time:
1. **Under-population:** Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (0).
2. **Survival:** Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive (1).
3. **Over-population:** Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (0).
4. **Reproduction:** Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (1).

### Problem Understanding:
We need to compute the next state of the board using the above rules for every cell simultaneously.

#### Follow-Up 1: In-Place Solution
To solve this problem **in-place**, we can use extra states to mark the transitions:
- `2` means the cell was alive but now dead.
- `3` means the cell was dead but now alive.

This allows us to store both the current and future state in the same board without needing extra space.

### In-Place Solution

1. **Rules:**
    - `0 -> 0` (dead remains dead).
    - `1 -> 0` (live dies) → Mark this as `2`.
    - `0 -> 1` (dead becomes alive) → Mark this as `3`.
    - `1 -> 1` (live remains alive).

2. **Steps:**
    1. First pass: Apply the transitions using the modified values `2` and `3`.
    2. Second pass: Convert all `2` to `0` and `3` to `1`.

3. **Helper Function:**
   - Count the number of live neighbors for a cell. This can be done by iterating over the 8 neighboring cells (if they exist).

### Code for In-Place Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

        def count_live_neighbors(r, c):
            directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
            live_neighbors = 0
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1:
                    live_neighbors += 1
            return live_neighbors

        # First pass: update the board in-place with the transition states (2 and 3)
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(i, j)

                if board[i][j] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:
                        board[i][j] = 2  # Live to dead
                elif board[i][j] == 0:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        board[i][j] = 3  # Dead to live

        # Second pass: finalize the board by converting 2->0 and 3->1
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 2:
                    board[i][j] = 0
                elif board[i][j] == 3:
                    board[i][j] = 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting live neighbors:** For each cell, we check its eight possible neighbors and count how many are alive.
2. **First pass:** We apply the transformation rules using intermediate values (`2` for live-to-dead, `3` for dead-to-live) to avoid overwriting information too early.
3. **Second pass:** After the first pass, we update the board by converting `2` back to `0` and `3` back to `1`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(m \* n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We process each cell twice: once for updating and once for finalizing.
- **Space complexity:** O(1), since the board is modified in place and no extra space is used apart from a few auxiliary variables.

### Follow-Up 2: Not In-Place Solution (Extra Space)
If you are allowed to use additional space, the task becomes simpler. You can maintain a **copy** of the board to store the next state and update the original board based on the copy.

### Code for Not In-Place Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        next_state = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        def count_live_neighbors(r, c):
            directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
            live_neighbors = 0
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and board[nr][nc] == 1:
                    live_neighbors += 1
            return live_neighbors

        # First pass: Calculate next state and store it in the next_state array
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(i, j)

                if board[i][j] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_state[i][j] = 1
                elif board[i][j] == 0:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        next_state[i][j] = 1

        # Second pass: Update the original board with the next state
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = next_state[i][j]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Create a `next_state` array:** This stores the next state of each cell.
2. **Calculate live neighbors:** For each cell, calculate how many live neighbors it has, just like in the in-place solution.
3. **Update the `next_state`:** Based on the neighbor count, update the `next_state` array according to the rules of the game.
4. **Update the original board:** Copy the contents of `next_state` back to the original `board`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(m \* n) — same as the in-place solution.
- **Space complexity:** O(m \* n), since we are using a separate array `next_state` of the same size as `board`.

---

### Follow-Up 3: Infinite Board
If the board is **infinite**, you need to handle the edges carefully. Two possible approaches:
1. **Bounded infinite board:** Treat cells outside the current grid as always dead (0). You can create a larger grid with extra padding and only simulate on the portion that includes all live cells.
2. **Dynamic space allocation:** Use a data structure like a set or dictionary to keep track of live cells. This way, you only store and update live cells, ignoring the dead cells.

This approach could be complex, but in practice, unless live cells propagate far, you can simulate the game within a reasonably large grid with padding for edge cells.


Let's break down this function, `count_live_neighbors`, which is commonly used in the **Game of Life** problem. This function is designed to count the number of live neighbors around a particular cell in a 2D grid (`board`), using a set of directions that represent all eight possible neighboring cells (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).

### Parameters:
- `r`: The row index of the current cell being examined.
- `c`: The column index of the current cell being examined.

### Function Purpose:
The goal of this function is to count how many live neighbors (cells with value `1`) surround a given cell located at position `(r, c)` on the `board`.

### Breakdown of Code:

1. **Directions Array:**
   ```python
   directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
   ```
   - The `directions` list contains 8 tuples, each representing the relative row and column changes needed to move to a neighboring cell:
     - `(-1, 0)`: Move up.
     - `(1, 0)`: Move down.
     - `(0, -1)`: Move left.
     - `(0, 1)`: Move right.
     - `(-1, -1)`: Move up-left (diagonally).
     - `(-1, 1)`: Move up-right (diagonally).
     - `(1, -1)`: Move down-left (diagonally).
     - `(1, 1)`: Move down-right (diagonally).
   - This array helps loop through all eight possible neighboring positions around the current cell `(r, c)`.

2. **Initialize `live_neighbors`:**
   ```python
   live_neighbors = 0
   ```
   - This variable keeps track of how many live neighbors are found around the cell `(r, c)`. Initially, it's set to `0`.

3. **Loop through the directions:**
   ```python
   for dr, dc in directions:
       nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
   ```
   - This `for` loop iterates over each tuple in the `directions` array.
   - `dr` and `dc` represent the change in row and column respectively for each direction.
   - `nr` and `nc` are the new row and column indices for the neighboring cell. These are calculated as the current cell's row and column (`r` and `c`) plus the directional offsets `dr` and `dc`.
   - For example, if `dr = -1` and `dc = 0` (move up), then the new row `nr` would be `r - 1`, and the new column `nc` would remain `c`.

4. **Check if the neighbor is valid and live:**
   ```python
   if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1:
   ```
   - **Bounds check**: `0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n`
     - This ensures that the neighboring cell `(nr, nc)` is within the bounds of the grid (`m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns). If the neighbor is out of bounds, it is ignored.
   - **Live cell check**: `abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1`
     - In the Game of Life, a live cell is typically represented by the value `1`. The function checks if the value at the neighboring cell is `1`.
     - The use of `abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1` is important because the cell values may be temporarily changed during the game evolution, such as using `-1` to mark a cell that was live but is now dead. Using `abs()` allows the function to recognize both `1` (currently live) and `-1` (was live before update) as live cells.

5. **Increment live neighbor count:**
   ```python
   live_neighbors += 1
   ```
   - If the neighbor cell is valid (within bounds) and live, the `live_neighbors` count is incremented by 1.

6. **Return the number of live neighbors:**
   ```python
   return live_neighbors
   ```
   - After checking all eight possible neighboring cells, the function returns the total count of live neighbors around the current cell.

### Example:
Let's say the board is a 3x3 grid, and you're checking the cell at position `(1, 1)`:

```
[
 [0, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0]
]
```

In this case, the center cell `(1, 1)` has 5 live neighbors: the cells `(0, 1)`, `(1, 0)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(0, 2)` all contain `1`. The function will loop over each direction, checking each neighbor, and return `5` as the number of live neighbors.

### Summary:
- This function counts the number of live neighbors around a given cell by examining the 8 possible directions.
- It ensures that neighbors are within bounds and live using the `abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1` condition.
- The result is the total count of live neighbors, which is then returned to help update the board state in the Game of Life logic.


Instead of manually defining the `directions` array, you can generate the eight directions dynamically using loops. Here's an approach using two nested loops to cover all possible directions:

### Code Example:
```python
def count_live_neighbors(r, c):
    live_neighbors = 0

    # Loop through all possible directions using row and column offsets
    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:   # Row offset: -1, 0, 1
        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:  # Column offset: -1, 0, 1
            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:
                continue  # Skip the current cell itself (r, c)

            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc

            # Check if the neighbor is within bounds and is live
            if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1:
                live_neighbors += 1

    return live_neighbors
```

### Explanation:
- **Row offset (`dr`) and Column offset (`dc`)**:
  - The outer loop iterates through the possible row offsets `-1`, `0`, and `1`.
  - The inner loop does the same for the column offsets.
  - This creates all possible direction combinations for the neighboring cells.

- **`if dr == 0 and dc == 0`:**
  - This condition ensures that you skip the current cell `(r, c)` itself, since its offset would be `(0, 0)`.

- **Bound and live check:**
  - For each of the neighboring cells, it checks if they are within bounds (`0 <= nr < m` and `0 <= nc < n`) and if the cell is live using `abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1`.

This loop approach dynamically covers all eight neighboring directions just like the original `directions` list, but without the need to manually define the possible directions.


Here is the exact copy of the explanation and modified code:

---

The issue you're encountering with the code is likely due to the transition states you are using (`2` for live-to-dead and `3` for dead-to-live) and how the neighbor counting is performed. Specifically, the logic of detecting live neighbors (`abs(board[nr][nc]) == 1`) is fine, but the way the transitions affect subsequent cells during the same iteration might cause unexpected behavior.

In the first pass, when you update the board, some cells that are transitioning may affect the result of other cells that haven't been processed yet.

### Here's a more detailed breakdown of the problem:

1. **Transition States Interference:**
   - When you update a live cell to dead (`2`), it can interfere with the neighbor counting for other cells.
   - Similarly, transitioning a dead cell to live (`3`) might also affect neighbor counting during the same pass.

### Solution:
To fix this, the key is ensuring that the transitions do not affect other cells in the same pass. The logic is correct, but you need to update the neighbors in such a way that they don't interfere with the current iteration's neighbor counting.

### Modified Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def gameOfLife(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])

        def count_live_neighbors(r, c):
            directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
            live_neighbors = 0
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and board[nr][nc] in (1, 2):  # Check for live cells
                    live_neighbors += 1
            return live_neighbors

        # First pass: update the board in-place with the transition states (2 and 3)
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(i, j)

                if board[i][j] == 1:  # Live cell
                    if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:
                        board[i][j] = 2  # Live to dead
                elif board[i][j] == 0:  # Dead cell
                    if live_neighbors == 3:
                        board[i][j] = 3  # Dead to live

        # Second pass: finalize the board by converting 2->0 and 3->1
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 2:
                    board[i][j] = 0
                elif board[i][j] == 3:
                    board[i][j] = 1
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **In the `count_live_neighbors` function**, I modified the condition for counting neighbors. Now it checks for `board[nr][nc] in (1, 2)`, meaning it considers both live cells (`1`) and cells that were live but are transitioning to dead (`2`). This ensures that transitioning states don't interfere with the neighbor counting.

With these changes, your test case should now work correctly:

**Input:**
```python
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
```

**Output:**
```python
[[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

This matches the expected result.
